        "response": "To address the issue, we need to consider how the `readUntilEndOfEntry` method is intended to function. The goal of this method is to skip over any remaining data in the current entry of a ZIP file until the end of the entry is reached. This is often necessary when reading ZIP files to ensure that the input stream is properly aligned for the next entry.\n\nThe current implementation reads data into `endOfEntryBuffer` in a loop until `read` returns -1, indicating the end of the entry. However, it seems the logic isn't correctly accounting for all cases, particularly when dealing with compressed data entries.\n\nHere is a revised version of the function that attempts to address these issues. It ensures that we read exactly the remaining bytes if the compressed size is known, thus preventing any accidental misalignment:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long bytesRemaining = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (bytesRemaining > 0) {\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, bytesRemaining));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break; // End of stream reached unexpectedly\n        }\n        bytesRemaining -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Buffer Initialization:** The `endOfEntryBuffer` is initialized if it's `null`. A default size of 512 bytes is used.\n- **Reading Loop:** The loop reads data into `endOfEntryBuffer`. It calculates how many bytes to read on each iteration by taking the minimum of the buffer size or the remaining bytes.\n- **Bytes Remaining:** We track the number of bytes remaining to be read (`bytesRemaining`) and decrease this count by the number of bytes actually read (`bytesRead`) in each iteration.\n- **End of Stream Handling:** If the `read` method returns -1, it indicates the end of the stream, and the loop exits early. This handles unexpected ends gracefully.\n\nThis should correctly handle skipping over compressed data entries, ensuring all bytes are read until the end of the entry. Adjustments may be necessary based on additional context or test cases.",
