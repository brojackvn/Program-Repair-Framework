        "response": "To address the issue in the `readUntilEndOfEntry` method, let's analyze the problem and the purpose of the function. The goal of this method is to read all the remaining bytes of the current zip entry until its end, particularly when dealing with compressed data. This is crucial for ensuring that the stream is correctly positioned for the next entry.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. **Infinite Loop**: The current implementation may result in an infinite loop if the `read()` method keeps returning `0`, which is a valid return value indicating no bytes were read but the end of stream hasn't been reached.\n2. **Incorrect Handling of Read Return Value**: The `read()` method returns the number of bytes read, or `-1` if the end of the stream is reached. The current code only checks for `-1`, which might not be sufficient.\n\n### Solution:\n- We need to ensure that the loop continues only while data is being read and stops once we've reached the end of the entry.\n- We should properly handle cases where `read()` returns `0` to avoid an infinite loop.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    int bytesRead;\n    while ((bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer)) != -1) {\n        // Ensure that we handle cases where read() returns 0 (no bytes read)\n        if (bytesRead == 0) {\n            // In case of 0 bytes read, we should attempt to read again.\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Buffer Initialization**: Ensure the buffer is initialized to hold the data being read.\n- **Reading Loop**: Use a `while` loop with an assignment to `bytesRead` to capture the number of bytes read.\n- **Check for Zero Reads**: If `bytesRead` is zero, it simply continues the loop to attempt reading again, ensuring we don't prematurely exit or loop infinitely.\n\nThis approach should handle the end of a stream correctly and ensure that the stream is positioned correctly for subsequent reads.",

Adjust the read size based on the remaining bytes.\n4. **Handle End of Stream:** If `read` returns `-1` before reading all expected bytes, it indicates an unexpected end of stream, and we throw an `IOException`.\n\nThis approach ensures we read exactly the amount of data specified by the entry's compressed size.

The `readUntilEndOfEntry` method should read through the current entry in the input stream until the end of the entry is reached. This is important when dealing with compressed files, where you need to ensure that all the data for the current entry is consumed before proceeding to the next entry.\n\nThe current implementation has a loop that reads data into a buffer until the end of the stream is reached. However, it does not account for the actual size of the data that should be read, which can be a problem if the stream contains additional data after the compressed entry. \n\nHere's a revised version of the function that aims to fix the problem by ensuring the correct amount of data is read:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long bytesToRead = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (bytesToRead > 0) {\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, bytesToRead));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            throw new IOException(\"Unexpected end of stream\");\n        }\n        bytesToRead -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Tracking Bytes to Read**: We track the number of bytes remaining to be read using `bytesToRead`, initialized to the compressed size of the entry.\n2. **Controlled Buffer Read**: In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the number of bytes to read based on the remaining bytes and the buffer size.
