        "response": "To address the issue with the `readUntilEndOfEntry` function, let's carefully analyze the code and the error message. The error message suggests that the function is not reading the expected amount of data, which likely results in incorrect behavior when reading zip entries. \n\nThe critical part of the function is the `while (read(endOfEntryBuffer) != -1);` line, which attempts to read data until the end of the entry is reached. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the amount of data being read. Additionally, the function should be careful to read exactly the amount of data specified by the `CompressedSize`.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remaining = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (remaining > 0) {\n        int toRead = (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remaining);\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, toRead);\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break; // End of stream reached unexpectedly\n        }\n        remaining -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Directory or Zero Compressed Size**: The function returns immediately if the entry is a directory or if the compressed size is zero, as these do not require any further reading.\n\n2. **Buffer Initialization**: If the buffer is not already initialized, a buffer with a fixed size (512 bytes in this case) is created.\n\n3. **Read Loop with Remaining Size**: \n    - We introduce a `remaining` variable to keep track of how many bytes are left to read based on the `CompressedSize` from the `localFileHeader`.\n    - In each iteration of the loop, we determine how much we need to read, which is the lesser of the buffer size or the remaining bytes.\n    - We read data into the buffer using `read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, toRead)`, which reads up to `toRead` bytes.\n    - If `read` returns `-1`, it indicates the end of the stream, and we break out of the loop.\n    - We decrement the `remaining` count by the number of bytes actually read (`bytesRead`).\n\nThis approach ensures that the function reads exactly the number of bytes specified by the `CompressedSize`, preventing premature termination of the reading process and addressing the discrepancy noted in the error message.",
