        "response": "To address the issue with the `readUntilEndOfEntry` method, let's analyze the current implementation and correct it.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Function Purpose**: The function `readUntilEndOfEntry` seems to be responsible for reading from a stream until the end of a zip entry is reached. It's likely used to skip over data when the specific entry data isn't needed.\n\n2. **Current Implementation**:\n   - It checks if the entry is a directory or if its compressed size is zero. If so, it returns immediately since there's nothing to read.\n   - It initializes a buffer (if not already initialized) to read chunks of data.\n   - It uses a loop with `read(endOfEntryBuffer) != -1` to read until EOF.\n\n3. **Bug Identification**:\n   - The loop reads data but does not ensure that the entire entry is read. The condition `read(endOfEntryBuffer) != -1` doesn't guarantee reading the full compressed size of the entry.\n   - The test case suggests that the data is not fully skipped, resulting in incorrect data being read subsequently.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo fix the bug, we should ensure that the function reads exactly the number of bytes specified by the compressed size of the entry. Here's the updated function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        int bytesToRead = (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes);\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, bytesToRead);\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break; // EOF reached unexpectedly\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: The method checks if the file is a directory or has a zero compressed size, returning early if so, as there's no data to read.\n- **Buffer Setup**: It initializes the buffer if it's null, ensuring it's ready to read chunks of data.\n- **Reading Loop**: \n  - We track `remainingBytes`, which starts as the compressed size of the entry.\n  - Inside the loop, we calculate `bytesToRead` as the minimum of the buffer size or the remaining bytes to ensure we don't read past the entry's end.\n  - We read into the buffer and update `remainingBytes` based on how many bytes were actually read.\n  - If `read` returns `-1`, it indicates an unexpected EOF, so we exit the loop.\n\nThis implementation ensures that all of the entry's data is read, avoiding issues where subsequent reads might consume data from the wrong entry.",
