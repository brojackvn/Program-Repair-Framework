The current implementation does not correctly handle the reading process and can lead to premature termination, resulting in the observed test failure.\n\nLet's break down the steps needed to correct the function:\n\n1. **Understand `read(byte[] b)` method**: This method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. In the current implementation, it reads until it encounters -1, but this doesn't necessarily mean it reads until the end of the current zip entry, especially if there's more than one entry.\n\n2. **Track bytes read**: We need to keep track of the total number of bytes read to ensure we reach the end of the current entry.\n\n3. **Compare with expected size**: Use the `localFileHeader.getCompressedSize()` to determine the amount of data to read.\n\nHere's how we can modify the `readUntilEndOfEntry` method:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long bytesRead = 0;\n    long compressedSize = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n\n    while (bytesRead < compressedSize) {\n        int bytesToRead = (int)Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, compressedSize - bytesRead);\n        int read = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, bytesToRead);\n        if (read == -1) {\n            break;  // End of stream reached unexpectedly\n        }\n        bytesRead += read;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Track `bytesRead`**: A variable `bytesRead` is used to track the total number of bytes read so far.\n- **Calculate `bytesToRead`**: Determine the number of bytes to read in each iteration, ensuring we do not exceed the `compressedSize`.\n- **Check for stream end**: If `read` returns `-1`, it means the end of the stream has been reached unexpectedly.\n- **Loop until all bytes are read**: Continue the loop until the number of bytes read matches the `compressedSize`.\n\nThis should fix the issue and ensure the method reads until the end of the entry correctly.",

The current implementation of reading until `-1` may not account for scenarios where fewer bytes are read than expected. Here's a revised approach to ensure the correct amount of data is consumed:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    int bytesRead;\n    \n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break;\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Zero Compressed Size or Directory**: If the entry is a directory or has a compressed size of zero, it immediately returns, as no data needs reading.\n\n2. **Initialize Buffer**: The buffer (`endOfEntryBuffer`) is initialized with a size of 512 bytes if it's not already set.\n\n3. **Track Remaining Bytes**: The `remainingBytes` variable tracks how much data still needs to be read. It starts with the total compressed size of the entry.\n\n4. **Read Loop**: The loop reads data in chunks, respecting the buffer size and the remaining bytes to be read. The `Math.min` function ensures that the read operation does not exceed the available data or buffer size.\n\n5. **Update Remaining Bytes**: After each read, the number of `remainingBytes` is decremented by the amount of data actually read.\n\nThis approach ensures that you read exactly the amount of data expected for the entry, addressing issues that may arise from reading less data than required.",
