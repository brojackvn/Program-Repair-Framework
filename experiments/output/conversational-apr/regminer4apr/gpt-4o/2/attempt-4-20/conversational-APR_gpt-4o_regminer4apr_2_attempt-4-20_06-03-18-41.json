        "response": "To address the issue in the `readUntilEndOfEntry` function, we need to ensure that the method reads the correct amount of data until the end of the entry, especially for compressed files. The current implementation has a few potential pitfalls:\n\n1. The method attempts to read data using a buffer but does not properly track the amount of data read.\n2. It assumes that reading until `-1` indicates the end of the entry, which may not correctly handle the specifics of compressed data.\n\nLet's consider a more accurate implementation:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    int bytesRead;\n\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int)Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            // Unexpected end of stream\n            throw new IOException(\"Unexpected end of entry\");\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization of `remainingBytes`:** We calculate the total number of bytes we expect to read using `localFileHeader.getCompressedSize()`. This helps us track how much data is still left to read.\n\n2. **Reading Loop:** We read data in chunks until `remainingBytes` becomes zero. The loop reads into `endOfEntryBuffer` and decreases `remainingBytes` by the number of bytes actually read.\n\n3. **Handling End-of-Stream:** If `read` returns `-1` before `remainingBytes` reaches zero, it means the stream ended unexpectedly, and we throw an `IOException`. This ensures the integrity of the read operation.\n\nThis revised method ensures that we precisely read the expected number of bytes for the entry, handling compressed data correctly and avoiding premature loop termination.",
