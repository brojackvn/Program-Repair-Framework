        "response": "To address the issue in the `readUntilEndOfEntry` function, we need to ensure that the entire entry is read correctly. The current implementation only checks if the `read` method returns `-1`, which indicates the end of the stream, but it doesn't consider the possibility of partial reads, which is a common scenario when reading from streams.\n\nThe issue arises because the `read` method returns the number of bytes read, and it is possible that it reads fewer bytes than requested. Therefore, to ensure we read until the end of the entry, we must accumulate the number of bytes read until we reach the expected total size of the entry.\n\nLet's fix the function by accumulating the total number of bytes read:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n  if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n    endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n  }\n\n  long totalBytesToRead = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n  long totalBytesRead = 0;\n\n  while (totalBytesRead < totalBytesToRead) {\n    int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, totalBytesToRead - totalBytesRead));\n    if (bytesRead == -1) {\n      throw new IOException(\"Unexpected end of stream\");\n    }\n    totalBytesRead += bytesRead;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Check for Directories and Zero Compressed Size**: If the entry is a directory or its compressed size is zero, we return early as there is nothing to read.\n\n2. **Initialize Buffer**: We ensure the buffer is initialized before reading.\n\n3. **Track Total Bytes**: We calculate the total number of bytes we need to read based on the compressed size of the entry (`totalBytesToRead`).\n\n4. **Read in a Loop**: We continue reading while the total number of bytes read (`totalBytesRead`) is less than the total bytes we need to read. We use `Math.min` to ensure that we do not read beyond the buffer size or the remaining bytes.\n\n5. **Check for End of Stream**: If `read` returns `-1` before reaching the expected number of bytes, we throw an `IOException` because this indicates an unexpected end of the stream.\n\nThis approach ensures that we read the entire entry, handling partial reads correctly, which should resolve the issue in your test cases.",
