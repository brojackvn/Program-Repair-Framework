        "response": "To address the issue, let's analyze the function step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function `readUntilEndOfEntry()` is designed to read through the remaining bytes of a file entry in a ZIP archive until the end of that entry. This is typically used when you need to skip over an entry's data without processing it, often because it's not needed or it's already been processed in some other way.\n\n2. **Current Logic**: \n   - The function first checks if the entry is a directory or if its compressed size is zero, in which case it returns immediately. This is logical because directories don't have data to skip, and entries with a compressed size of zero have no content.\n   - It initializes a buffer (`endOfEntryBuffer`) if it's null.\n   - Then it continuously reads into this buffer until the `read()` function returns `-1`, indicating the end of the entry.\n\n3. **Issue in Logic**:\n   - The current implementation assumes that calling `read(endOfEntryBuffer)` will always read the entire remaining data of the current entry in one go or in multiple iterations until `-1` is returned.\n   - The issue arises when the `read()` method does not handle the transition between entries correctly, especially when skipping data. The `read()` method might be returning `0` or a positive number but not the full length of `endOfEntryBuffer`, leading to incomplete reading of entries.\n\n4. **Solution**:\n   - Ensure that we read exactly the compressed size of the entry. We should keep track of how many bytes we've read and continue until we've read the entire entry.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    int bytesRead;\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int)Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            // Unexpected EOF, this could be an error or just the end of data\n            break;\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix**:\n- We calculate the `remainingBytes` as the `CompressedSize` of the entry.\n- During each iteration, we read into `endOfEntryBuffer` but only up to the minimum of the buffer size or the number of remaining bytes.\n- We update `remainingBytes` by subtracting the number of `bytesRead`.\n- The loop continues until `remainingBytes` becomes zero, indicating we have read the entire entry data, or `read()` returns `-1`, indicating an end-of-file condition unexpectedly (which should not normally occur if the compressed size is correctly specified).\n\nThis approach should ensure that all data of the entry is read and skipped correctly, addressing the test case failures.",
