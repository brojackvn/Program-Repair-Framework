        "response": "To address the issue you're facing, let's carefully analyze the function and see how it can be corrected. The function `readUntilEndOfEntry()` is designed to read the remaining bytes of a compressed file entry in a ZIP stream until the end of that entry is reached. However, the current implementation does not account for how much data should be read, which may lead to incorrect behavior or incomplete reads.\n\nHere's a possible corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        int bytesToRead = (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes);\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, bytesToRead);\n\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break; // End of stream\n        }\n\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Directory or Zero Compressed Size**: If the entry is a directory or has a compressed size of zero, we return immediately as there is nothing to read.\n\n2. **Buffer Initialization**: Ensure the buffer is initialized only once.\n\n3. **Track Remaining Bytes**: We keep track of how many bytes are left to read using `remainingBytes`, which is initialized to the compressed size of the entry.\n\n4. **Read in Chunks**: In each iteration of the loop, we calculate how many bytes we should read. This is the lesser of the buffer size or the remaining bytes.\n\n5. **Check for End of Stream**: If `read()` returns `-1`, it indicates the end of the stream, and we break the loop.\n\n6. **Update Remaining Bytes**: After each read operation, we subtract the number of bytes read from `remainingBytes`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we read exactly the number of bytes expected for each entry, preventing any discrepancies in test outcomes.",
