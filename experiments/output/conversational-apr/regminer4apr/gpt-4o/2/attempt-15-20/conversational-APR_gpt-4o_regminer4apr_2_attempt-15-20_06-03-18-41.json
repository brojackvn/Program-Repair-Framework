The method `read()` returning `-1` usually indicates the end of the stream, which is not what we want to rely on for processing individual entries within a zip file. Instead, we should read until we've consumed all bytes for the current entry as indicated by its compressed size.\n\nHere's the revised function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            // Unexpected end of stream, handle error accordingly\n            throw new IOException(\"Unexpected end of entry while reading.\");\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Directory or Zero Size**: If the entry is a directory or its compressed size is `0`, we simply return because there's no data to read.\n\n2. **Initialize Buffer**: We initialize a buffer if it's not already initialized.\n\n3. **Read Remaining Bytes**: We calculate the `remainingBytes` based on the compressed size from the `localFileHeader`.\n\n4. **Read Loop**: We continue reading until `remainingBytes` is `0`. Each iteration reads up to the smaller of the buffer size or the remaining bytes. We update the `remainingBytes` with the number of bytes actually read.\n\n5. **Handle Unexpected End**: If `read()` returns `-1` before `remainingBytes` reaches `0`, we throw an `IOException` because that indicates an unexpected end of stream for the current entry.\n\nThis ensures that we read exactly the number of bytes expected for the entry, thereby addressing the problem identified by the test case.",
