        "response": "To address the bug in the `readUntilEndOfEntry` method, we need to ensure that the entire entry is properly read, especially when the entry has non-zero compressed size. The current implementation reads data in a loop but doesn't handle the returned number of bytes correctly. The `read` method likely returns the number of bytes read, and when it returns `-1`, it indicates the end of the stream.\n\nThe issue may be that the method reads until it stops returning data, but if the data is smaller than the buffer size, it could potentially skip over the remaining bytes. Additionally, it does not accumulate the total bytes read to ensure it reads until the specified compressed size is reached. Let's revise the function to fix this issue:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            // Unexpected end of stream\n            throw new IOException(\"Unexpected end of stream while reading entry data\");\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Buffer Initialization**: We initialize `endOfEntryBuffer` if it is null.\n\n2. **Read Loop**: We loop until all the bytes specified by `localFileHeader.getCompressedSize()` are read.\n\n3. **Handling Bytes Read**: For each read operation, we calculate the minimum of the buffer size and the remaining bytes to ensure we don't read past the end of the entry.\n\n4. **Check for EOF**: If `read` returns `-1` before we have read all the expected bytes, we throw an `IOException`, indicating that the end of the stream was reached unexpectedly.\n\n5. **Decrement Remaining Bytes**: We decrement `remainingBytes` by the number of bytes read in each iteration to track how much more data needs to be read.\n\nThis approach ensures that we read exactly the number of bytes indicated by `localFileHeader.getCompressedSize()` or until the stream ends unexpectedly.",
