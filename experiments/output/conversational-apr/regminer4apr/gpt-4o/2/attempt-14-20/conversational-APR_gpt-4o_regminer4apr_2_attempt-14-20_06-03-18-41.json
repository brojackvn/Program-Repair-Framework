        "response": "To address the issue you're encountering, let's analyze the function and understand the potential cause of the problem.\n\nThe function `readUntilEndOfEntry()` is designed to read data until the end of a zip entry. The test case failure indicates that the expected number of bytes read is not matching the actual number of bytes read. This suggests that the loop reading through the data might not be functioning as intended.\n\nLet's break down the code and potential issues:\n1. The `read()` method should ideally read data into the buffer until there is no more data to read, returning `-1` to indicate the end of the stream.\n2. The loop `while (read(endOfEntryBuffer) != -1);` is attempting to read data, but it doesn't account for partial reads.\n3. If `read()` returns a value greater than `0` but less than the buffer size, the loop will continue without handling that data properly.\n4. We need to ensure that all data is read and that we handle cases where `read()` reads fewer bytes than the buffer size.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n  if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n    endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n  }\n\n  int bytesRead;\n  while ((bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer)) != -1) {\n    // Process the bytes read, if necessary\n    // For now, we're just reading until the end\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this revised function:\n- We store the result of `read(endOfEntryBuffer)` in the variable `bytesRead`.\n- We use a `while` loop to continue reading until `read()` returns `-1`, indicating the end of the stream.\n- This approach handles partial reads correctly by using the `bytesRead` variable to account for the number of bytes read in each iteration.\n\nThis should resolve the issue by ensuring that all the bytes are read correctly until the end of the entry, and the function behaves as expected in various scenarios, including partial reads.",

This helps in determining how many bytes are left to be read.\n\n4. **Read Loop**: \n   - Determine how many bytes to read in each iteration, which should be the minimum of the buffer size or the remaining bytes.\n   - Adjust the `read` method call to read a specific number of bytes into the buffer.\n   - Update the `remainingBytes` with the actual number of bytes read.\n   - Break the loop if the end of the stream is reached unexpectedly (`bytesRead == -1`).\n\nThis approach ensures that you read exactly the number of bytes specified by the `compressedSize`, handling any partial reads correctly.",
