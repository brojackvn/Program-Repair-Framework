        "response": "To fix the bug in the `readUntilEndOfEntry` method, we need to ensure that the method reads the correct amount of data from the stream. The current implementation reads data until it reaches the end of the stream (`read(endOfEntryBuffer) != -1`), but it should only read until the end of the current entry.\n\nThe method should read exactly the number of bytes specified by the `getCompressedSize()` method of `localFileHeader`. Hereâ€™s how we can correct the function:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long bytesToRead = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    long totalBytesRead = 0;\n\n    while (totalBytesRead < bytesToRead) {\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, (int)Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, bytesToRead - totalBytesRead));\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break; // Unexpected end of stream, but we should break to avoid infinite loop\n        }\n        totalBytesRead += bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Buffer Initialization**: The buffer is initialized if it's null. This buffer is used for reading chunks of data.\n\n2. **Calculate Bytes to Read**: We calculate the total number of bytes to read from the stream using `localFileHeader.getCompressedSize()`.\n\n3. **Read Loop**: A loop is used to read data into `endOfEntryBuffer` until the total bytes read matches the compressed size of the entry.\n   - The `read` method is called with a limit that ensures we don't read more than what is needed to complete the current entry.\n   - We track the total number of bytes read using `totalBytesRead`.\n\n4. **Breaking the Loop**: If `read` returns `-1`, indicating the end of the stream, we break out of the loop to avoid an infinite loop scenario.\n\nThis corrected method should now correctly read only the current entry's data as specified by the compressed size, preventing errors related to reading past the entry's end.",
