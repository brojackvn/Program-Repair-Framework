The current implementation reads data into the `endOfEntryBuffer` but does not account for the actual size of the entry that needs to be read. This can cause discrepancies, especially if the entry size is not a multiple of the buffer size.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function that attempts to read exactly the number of bytes specified by `localFileHeader.getCompressedSize()`:\n\n```java\nprivate void readUntilEndOfEntry() throws IOException {\n    if (localFileHeader.isDirectory() || localFileHeader.getCompressedSize() == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (endOfEntryBuffer == null) {\n        endOfEntryBuffer = new byte[512];\n    }\n\n    long remainingBytes = localFileHeader.getCompressedSize();\n    while (remainingBytes > 0) {\n        int bytesToRead = (int) Math.min(endOfEntryBuffer.length, remainingBytes);\n        int bytesRead = read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, bytesToRead);\n        if (bytesRead == -1) {\n            break; // If end of stream is reached unexpectedly\n        }\n        remainingBytes -= bytesRead;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate Remaining Bytes:** We initialize `remainingBytes` with the compressed size of the entry. This tells us how many bytes we still need to read to reach the end of the entry.\n\n2. **Read Loop with Buffer Size:** In each iteration of the loop, we determine how many bytes we should attempt to read (`bytesToRead`). This is the smaller of the buffer size or the remaining bytes.\n\n3. **Read Method with Offset and Length:** We use the `read` method with three parameters (`read(endOfEntryBuffer, 0, bytesToRead)`) to specify the buffer, offset, and the number of bytes to read. This ensures that we do not read more than necessary.\n\n4. **Update Remaining Bytes:** After reading, we subtract the number of bytes actually read (`bytesRead`) from `remainingBytes`.\n\n5. **Handle End of Stream:** If `read` returns `-1`, it indicates that the end of the stream is unexpectedly reached, and we break out of the loop.\n\nThis approach ensures that you read the exact number of bytes specified by the compressed size, handling cases where the entry size is not a multiple of the buffer size.",
