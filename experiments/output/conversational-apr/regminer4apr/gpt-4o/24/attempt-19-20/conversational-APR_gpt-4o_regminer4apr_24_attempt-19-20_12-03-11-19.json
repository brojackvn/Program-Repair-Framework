This can lead to resource leaks, which is likely causing the test case failure. To fix this, we can use a `try-catch-finally` block to ensure both streams are closed, regardless of any exceptions that might occur.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    IOException exception = null;\n    try {\n        this.input.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        exception = e;\n    }\n    try {\n        this.output.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        if (exception != null) {\n            exception.addSuppressed(e);\n        } else {\n            exception = e;\n        }\n    }\n    if (exception != null) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Exception Handling:** We initialize an `IOException` variable `exception` to `null` and use it to store any exceptions that occur.\n   \n2. **Try-Catch Blocks:** We attempt to close both `input` and `output` streams in separate try-catch blocks:\n   - If closing `input` throws an exception, we store it in `exception`.\n   - If closing `output` throws an exception and an exception was already caught when closing `input`, we add the new exception as a suppressed exception to the existing `exception`. Otherwise, we store it in `exception`.\n\n3. **Throwing the Exception:** After attempting to close both streams, if `exception` is not `null`, we throw it. This ensures that the method informs the caller of any issues while also trying to close both resources.\n\nThis approach ensures both streams are closed, and any exceptions are properly handled and reported.",

The `close` method should ensure that both `input` and `output` streams are closed properly, even if one of the `close` operations fails.
