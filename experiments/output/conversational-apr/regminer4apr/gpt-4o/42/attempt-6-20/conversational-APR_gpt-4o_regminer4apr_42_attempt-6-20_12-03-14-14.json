        "response": "To fix the `isInvisibleChar` function, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies invisible characters. The error suggests that the function currently returns `false` for some characters when it should return `true`.\n\nThe current implementation checks if the character type is `16`, which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT` in Java. However, it also includes a condition that requires the character to be one of the specific values: 8203 (zero width space), 8204 (zero width non-joiner), 8205 (zero width joiner), or 173 (soft hyphen). This condition seems overly restrictive because it first checks the type and then limits the character values.\n\nHere's a revised implementation that should correctly identify invisible characters:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is a format character or a soft hyphen\n    return Character.getType(c) == Character.FORMAT || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Character.FORMAT**: This covers a range of invisible characters, including zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, and zero-width joiner. \n- **Soft Hyphen (173)**: This is a special case because the soft hyphen is not always considered a format character depending on its usage, so we explicitly check for it.\n\nThis function should now correctly identify the relevant invisible characters without requiring them to be part of a specific set of values unless necessary. This change should address the issue seen in the test case and return the expected results.",

        "response": "To address the issue, let's first clarify the purpose of the `isInvisibleChar` function. The function is intended to identify characters that are \"invisible\" or have no visible representation in text. The original function checks for specific Unicode code points and uses `Character.getType(c)` to check if the character type is `16` (which corresponds to `FORMAT` in the Unicode specification).\n\nThe error indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the invisible characters needed for the test. The problem may be with the logic or the specific conditions used to identify these characters. Let's adjust the function to ensure it correctly identifies invisible characters:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function now directly checks if the character is one of the specific invisible characters without relying on `Character.getType(c)`. This change ensures that the function accurately identifies the intended invisible characters.\n- The characters checked are:\n  - `8203`: Zero Width Space (ZWSP)\n  - `8204`: Zero Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ)\n  - `8205`: Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ)\n  - `173`: Soft Hyphen (SHY)\n\nWith this change, the function should correctly identify these invisible characters, potentially resolving the test case failure. If there are other invisible characters that need to be detected, they should also be explicitly added to this list.",
