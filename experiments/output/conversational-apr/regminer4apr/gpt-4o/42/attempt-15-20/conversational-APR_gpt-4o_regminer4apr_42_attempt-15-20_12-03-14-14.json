The original implementation checks if the character's type is equal to 16, which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT`. However, this alone does not guarantee the character is one of the specified invisible characters. Let's correct the logic:\n\n1. We should first check if the character `c` is one of the specified invisible characters: zero width space (8203), zero width non-joiner (8204), zero width joiner (8205), or soft hyphen (173).\n2.

The current function checks for a specific type and character values, but it seems there's a misunderstanding about which types or specific characters should be considered \"invisible.\" Let's reevaluate and correct the function:\n\nIn Unicode, invisible characters often include various types of whitespace and format characters.
