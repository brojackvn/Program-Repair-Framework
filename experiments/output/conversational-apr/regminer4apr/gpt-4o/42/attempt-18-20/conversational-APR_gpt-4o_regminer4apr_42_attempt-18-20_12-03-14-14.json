        "response": "To address the issue in the `isInvisibleChar` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the \"invisible\" characters. The current implementation seems to have a logical flaw because it combines a check for the character type with specific character codes using an `&&` condition. \n\nTo fix this, we should check if the character code matches any of the \"invisible\" characters directly, without the need to check the character type. Additionally, the character type `16` corresponds to `FORMAT` characters, but not all \"invisible\" characters fall under this category, such as the soft hyphen.\n\nHere's how you can correct the function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Zero Width Space (ZWSP):** Unicode `U+200B` or `8203`.\n2. **Zero Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ):** Unicode `U+200C` or `8204`.\n3. **Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ):** Unicode `U+200D` or `8205`.\n4. **Soft Hyphen (SHY):** Unicode `U+00AD` or `173`.\n\nBy directly checking if the character code matches any of these specific invisible characters, we ensure that the function behaves as expected without being incorrectly limited by the character type. This should resolve the issues with the test cases that involve these characters.",
