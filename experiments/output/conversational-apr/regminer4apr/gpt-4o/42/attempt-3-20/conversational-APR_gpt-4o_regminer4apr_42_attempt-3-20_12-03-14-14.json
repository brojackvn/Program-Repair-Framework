        "response": "To address the bug, let's analyze what the `isInvisibleChar` function is supposed to do and why it might be failing. The function is intended to determine if a given character is an \"invisible\" character, specifically targeting:\n\n- Zero Width Space (U+200B)\n- Zero Width Non-Joiner (U+200C)\n- Zero Width Joiner (U+200D)\n- Soft Hyphen (U+00AD)\n\nThe current implementation checks if the character type is 16 (which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT` in Java) and then checks if the character is one of the specified invisible characters. However, it seems there is an issue with this implementation that causes test failures.\n\nLet's break down the logic and fix it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Character Type Check:** \n   - We should check if the character type is `FORMAT`, which is indeed type 16. This part of the logic is correct for checking characters like Zero Width Space, Zero Width Non-Joiner, and Zero Width Joiner, as they are format characters.\n\n2. **Specific Character Check:**\n   - We need to ensure that the character is one of the specific invisible characters listed.\n\n3. **Logical Combination:**\n   - The current logical AND (`&&`) is likely limiting the function to return true only if both conditions are simultaneously satisfied, which may not be appropriate for all characters listed.\n\n4. **The Soft Hyphen:**\n   - The soft hyphen (U+00AD) might not always be treated the same way as the other zero width characters in terms of type classification, so we must ensure our logic allows for its inclusion.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is a format type or specifically a soft hyphen\n    return (Character.getType(c) == Character.FORMAT && (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205)) || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Character.getType(c) == Character.FORMAT:** This checks if the character is of type `FORMAT`. The zero width characters are of this type.\n- **(c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205):** These are the Unicode code points for Zero Width Space, Zero Width Non-Joiner, and Zero Width Joiner, respectively.\n- **c == 173:** This checks specifically for the Soft Hyphen, which may not always be classified under `FORMAT` but is considered invisible in terms of display.\n\nThe logic now separates the general format check from the specific soft hyphen check, which should address the issue in the failing test cases.",

        "response": "To fix the function `isInvisibleChar`, we should reconsider the logic of checking whether a character is invisible. The current implementation checks for a specific character type (`Character.getType(c) == 16`) and a set of specific character values. However, the character type check might be incorrect.\n\nThe `Character.getType` method returns different values corresponding to different character types, and the type `16` corresponds to `FORMAT` characters. The invisible characters you want to check for (zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, zero-width joiner, and soft hyphen) are indeed format characters, but the logic should be that any of these characters should be considered invisible regardless of the type check.\n\nLet's revise the function to correctly identify these specific characters as invisible:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Zero-width space (U+200B), zero-width non-joiner (U+200C), \n    // zero-width joiner (U+200D), and soft hyphen (U+00AD)\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\nIn this revised version, the function only checks if the character `c` is one of the specified invisible characters without the `Character.getType` check, which should fix the issue you've encountered. This approach directly checks for the specific Unicode code points corresponding to the invisible characters.",
