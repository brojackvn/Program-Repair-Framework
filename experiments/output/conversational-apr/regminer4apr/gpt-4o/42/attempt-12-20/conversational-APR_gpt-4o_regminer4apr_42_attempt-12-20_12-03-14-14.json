        "response": "To address the issue with the `isInvisibleChar` function, let's analyze the original code and the problem it tries to solve. The function aims to determine whether a character is an \"invisible\" character, specifically checking for certain zero-width and non-visible characters.\n\n### Original Code Analysis\n\nThe function currently checks if the character type is `16` (which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT` in Java) and if the character matches one of the specified invisible characters:\n- Zero Width Space (U+200B)\n- Zero Width Non-Joiner (U+200C)\n- Zero Width Joiner (U+200D)\n- Soft Hyphen (U+00AD)\n\n### Problem\n\nThe function uses `Character.getType(c) == 16` to check if the character is a format type. However, this alone might not account for all relevant conditions or might not correctly filter out visible characters.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet's focus on the characters we know to be invisible. We need to check if the character matches one of the specified Unicode code points. The `Character.getType()` check might not be necessary here because we're already explicitly checking for specific invisible characters.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Direct Matching**: We directly compare the integer value `c` to the Unicode code points of the invisible characters. This is a straightforward check and doesn't rely on `Character.getType()`, which might introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\n2. **Simplicity**: By removing the `Character.getType(c) == 16` condition, the function becomes simpler and more focused on checking only the specified invisible characters.\n\nThis version should address the issue related to the test case mentioned in the error message by ensuring that only the specified invisible characters return `true`.",

However, the type `16` does not necessarily correspond to these characters; instead, it might be more appropriate to directly check if the character is one of the specified invisible characters.\n\nLet's adjust the function by removing the type check and solely checking if the character is one of the specified invisible characters:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, zero-width joiner, or soft hyphen\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\nThis function now directly checks if the character is one of the specific invisible characters without relying on the character type, which should address the issue indicated by the test error.
