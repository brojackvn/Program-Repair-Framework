        "response": "To address the issue with the `isInvisibleChar` function, we need to properly identify invisible characters. The current logic checks if the character type is `16` (which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT` in Java), and then checks for specific invisible characters such as zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, zero-width joiner, and soft hyphen. However, it seems like the logic or the test is not handling the requirements correctly.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the logic:\n\n1. **Invisible Characters**: These are typically characters that don't have a visible representation. In Unicode, these include zero-width space (U+200B), zero-width non-joiner (U+200C), zero-width joiner (U+200D), and soft hyphen (U+00AD).\n\n2. **Character Type**: In Java, the `Character.getType(int codePoint)` method returns a constant indicating the character's general category, such as letter, digit, punctuation, etc. For the characters we are interested in, they should fall under the `Character.FORMAT` category, which is represented by the constant value `16`.\n\nGiven the above, the current logic seems to be checking both the type and specific code points, which is generally correct. However, the issue may arise from the sequence or additional conditions in the test case.\n\nLet's refine the function to ensure it correctly identifies the invisible characters without relying on the type check, as it's redundant when checking specific known invisible characters:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check for specific invisible characters directly\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\nThis refined function directly checks for the specific Unicode code points of the invisible characters without considering the character type, which may simplify the logic and avoid potential mismatches in conditions. By focusing on the specific known invisible characters, we ensure that the function behaves as expected in relevant test cases.",

Instead, we should simply check if the character is one of the specified invisible characters.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\nThis function checks if the character `c` is one of the specified invisible characters directly, without relying on `Character.getType(c)`.
