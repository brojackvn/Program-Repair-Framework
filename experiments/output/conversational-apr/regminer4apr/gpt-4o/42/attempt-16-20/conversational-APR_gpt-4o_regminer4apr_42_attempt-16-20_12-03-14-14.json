However, not all of these specific characters have a type of `Character.FORMAT`. The logic should be simplified to just check if the character is one of the specific invisible characters listed.\n\nLet's correct the function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is one of the specific invisible characters\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated function, we simply return `true` if the character `c` is one of the specified codes, which are:\n\n- 8203: Zero Width Space (U+200B)\n- 8204: Zero Width Non-Joiner (U+200C)\n- 8205: Zero Width Joiner (U+200D)\n- 173: Soft Hyphen (U+00AD)\n\nThis change should resolve the issue by directly checking for the presence of those characters, without involving the `Character.getType` method, which was unnecessary for this check and might have caused the logic to fail in certain cases.",

The function aims to identify certain invisible characters, but there might be a misunderstanding of how the `Character.getType()` method works or the condition logic.\n\nThe original function checks if the character type is `16`, which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT`. The expected characters are zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, zero-width joiner, and soft hyphen. These are indeed format characters, so the character type check seems correct.\n\nThe issue might be related to the logical `AND` operator (`&&`) used in the function. The check should correctly identify the characters based on either their type or a direct match with the specified Unicode points.\n\nLet's revise the function to ensure it accurately identifies these characters:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is one of the specific invisible characters\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\nIn this revised version, we directly check if `c` is one of the specified Unicode points. This approach should address the logic error and ensure that each specific invisible character is accurately identified. The check for `Character.getType(c) == 16` is no longer necessary because we are directly matching the Unicode points of the known invisible characters.
