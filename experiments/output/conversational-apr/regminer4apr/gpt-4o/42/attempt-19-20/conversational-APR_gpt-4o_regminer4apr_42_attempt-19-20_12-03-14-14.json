The error message indicates that the function does not behave as expected for certain test cases, specifically concerning the zero-width joiner (ZWJ).\n\nLet's analyze the implementation:\n\n1. `Character.getType(c) == 16` checks if the character type is `FORMAT`. The constant `16` corresponds to `Character.FORMAT`.\n\n2. The condition also checks if `c` is one of the specific invisible characters: zero width space (8203), zero width non-joiner (8204), zero width joiner (8205), or soft hyphen (173).\n\nThe issue likely arises because the condition requires both the type to be `FORMAT` and the character to be one of the specified invisible characters, which might not correctly capture all cases where a character is considered invisible.\n\nTo fix this, we can simplify the logic by directly checking if the character is one of the specified invisible characters, since we are explicitly listing them. The `Character.getType` check may be unnecessary if our goal is just to check for these specific invisible characters.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\nThis function now directly checks if the character is one of the specified invisible characters, which should correctly handle the test cases and resolve the error.",
