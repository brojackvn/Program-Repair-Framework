The current implementation checks if the character type is `16`, which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT`. However, it also incorrectly combines this with a check to see if the character is one of a few specific code points.\n\nGiven the error message and the context, it seems like there might be a logical error in how the conditions are combined. Currently, it requires the character to be both of type `FORMAT` and match one of the specific code points, which might not be the intended logic.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function, which only checks if the character is one of the specified \"invisible\" characters:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Character Type Check Removed**: The check for `Character.getType(c) == 16` is removed because we are specifically interested in the four Unicode code points that are considered invisible for the context of your application.\n\n2. **Logical OR**: The method now simply returns `true` if the character matches any of the invisible characters (zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen).\n\nThis adjustment should resolve the error by accurately identifying invisible characters according to the expected logic.",
