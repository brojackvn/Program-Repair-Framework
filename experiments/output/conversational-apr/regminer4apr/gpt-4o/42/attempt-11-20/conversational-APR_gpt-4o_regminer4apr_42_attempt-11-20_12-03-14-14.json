The function is supposed to determine if a character is an \"invisible\" character, which usually means characters that do not have a visual representation or affect the layout of text in certain ways.\n\nThe original function checks if the character's type is 16, which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT` in Java. However, this is unnecessarily restrictive because not all invisible characters will have this type, and some characters with this type may not be considered invisible in the context of your application.\n\nLet's rewrite the function to correctly identify the invisible characters you are interested in: zero-width space (U+200B), zero-width non-joiner (U+200C), zero-width joiner (U+200D), and soft hyphen (U+00AD).\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, zero-width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We no longer check `Character.getType(c) == 16` because it isn't necessary for identifying the specific invisible characters we're interested in.\n- Instead, we simply check if the input character `c` is one of the Unicode code points for zero-width space (U+200B, which is 8203), zero-width non-joiner (U+200C, which is 8204), zero-width joiner (U+200D, which is 8205), or soft hyphen (U+00AD, which is 173).\n\nThis function should now correctly identify the invisible characters specified in your requirements.",

The original function checks for both the character type and specific code points, but it seems to be incorrectly handling these conditions.

We should ensure we are checking for the correct character types.\n\n2. **Specific Code Points**: The function should correctly identify the given code points as invisible characters.\n\nLet's adjust the function to ensure both conditions are properly checked:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Checking if the character is a non-spacing mark or a format character\n    int charType = Character.getType(c);\n    boolean isNonSpacingMark = charType == Character.NON_SPACING_MARK;\n    boolean isFormatChar = charType == Character.FORMAT;\n\n    // Check if the character is one of the specific invisible characters\n    boolean isSpecificInvisible = (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173);\n\n    return isNonSpacingMark || isFormatChar || isSpecificInvisible;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Character Type Checks**:\n  - `Character.NON_SPACING_MARK` (combining characters that do not occupy space).\n  - `Character.FORMAT` (characters that affect the display or behavior of surrounding text).\n\n- **Specific Code Points**:\n  - We include the original code points 8203 (ZERO WIDTH SPACE), 8204 (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER), 8205 (ZERO WIDTH JOINER), and 173 (SOFT HYPHEN).\n\nThis updated function should correctly identify invisible characters by both type and specific code points.
