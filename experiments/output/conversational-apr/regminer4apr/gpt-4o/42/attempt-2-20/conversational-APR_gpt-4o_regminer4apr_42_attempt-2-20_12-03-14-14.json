The character codes for these are:\n- ZWSP: 8203\n- ZWNJ: 8204\n- ZWJ: 8205\n- Soft Hyphen: 173\n\nThe error message indicates that the current implementation does not behave as expected. Specifically, it seems that the logic to determine if a character is invisible might be incorrect, as the expected and actual results differ.\n\nThe current implementation checks if the character type is equal to 16 (`Character.getType(c) == 16`), which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT`. However, this check might be unnecessary because we can directly check if the character matches one of the specified invisible characters.\n\nLet's refactor the function to directly check if the character matches one of the specified codes, without relying on `Character.getType()`:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is one of the specified invisible characters.\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\nThis refactored function should correctly identify the invisible characters by directly comparing the integer values of the characters to the known codes. This approach is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity. Now, the function should pass the test cases without errors.",

The original function checks if a character is a specific set of \"invisible\" characters by comparing both the character type and specific code points. However, the logic seems incorrect in determining if a character should be considered invisible.\n\n### Understanding the Issue:\n1. The function checks if `Character.getType(c) == 16`, which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT`.\n2. It then checks if `c` matches one of the specific code points (8203, 8204, 8205, or 173).

The original combination of conditions seems to be too restrictive. Let's redefine the function by considering that each of these characters should be individually checked, without combining the `Character.getType(c)` condition unless necessary.\n\nHere is a corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We directly check if the character `c` is one of the specified code points without the need to check `Character.getType(c) == 16`, as the code points themselves adequately define the invisible characters we are interested in.\n- This ensures that the function correctly identifies any of these characters as invisible without requiring additional type checking.\n\nThis should resolve the discrepancy observed in the test case.
