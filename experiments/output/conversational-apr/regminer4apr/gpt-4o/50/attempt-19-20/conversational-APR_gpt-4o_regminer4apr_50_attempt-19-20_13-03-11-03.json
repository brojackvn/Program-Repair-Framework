The `assign` function is intended to update a portion of a `stack` with given `values` and return a new `Frame` object.

If `stack` is an array of objects, changes to the objects themselves will affect the original `stack`. Ensure this is the intended behavior.\n\n2. **Parameter Handling:** The logic involving `nparm` (the number of arguments the scope expects) and `curried` (presumably the number of arguments already supplied) must be correct. Verify if `curried` should indeed be subtracted from `nparm`.\n\n3. **Bounds Checking:** Ensure that you're not trying to copy more elements than the `stack` can hold.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function with these considerations:\n\n```java\npublic Frame assign(Object... values) {\n    if (stack != null && values != null && values.length > 0) {\n        int nparm = scope.getArgCount();\n        // Adjust the logic to ensure we don't exceed the size of stack\n        int maxCopyLength = Math.min(stack.length - curried, values.length);\n        int ncopy = Math.min(nparm - curried, maxCopyLength);\n        \n        if (ncopy > 0) {\n            Object[] copy = stack.clone();\n            System.arraycopy(values, 0, copy, curried, ncopy);\n            return new Frame(scope, copy, curried + ncopy);\n        }\n    }\n    return this;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **`maxCopyLength`:** Ensures that the number of elements copied does not exceed the available space in the `stack`.\n- **`ncopy`:** Calculated as the minimum of the number of parameters left to fill and the actual number of values that can be copied. This ensures you don't attempt to copy beyond the boundaries of the `stack` or `values`.\n\n### Suggestions:\n- **Test Thoroughly:** Make sure to test with edge cases such as when `values` is longer than `stack`, when `curried` exceeds `nparm`, and when `stack` is nearly full.\n- **Clarify `curried`:** Ensure that `curried` is being used correctly.
