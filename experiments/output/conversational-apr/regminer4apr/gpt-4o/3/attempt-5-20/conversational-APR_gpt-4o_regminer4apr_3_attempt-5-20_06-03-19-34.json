This is correct.\n   - If `left` is TRUE, the result should be `right`. This is also correct.\n   - If `right` is FALSE, the result should be the negation of `left`. This is correct.\n\n2. **Equivalent Formulas**:\n   - If `left` equals `right`, the implication should be TRUE. This logic is correct.\n\n3. **Negated Formulas**:\n   - If `left` is the negation of `right`, the implication should be `right` (which is FALSE, as `left` being the negation of `right` implies FALSE). The current logic incorrectly returns `left.negate()`.\n\n4. **Handling Implication Caching**:\n   - The caching mechanism seems fine, but we need to ensure the logic above is accurate before caching.\n\nThe primary issue seems to be with how negated formulas are handled. Let's correct the logic for negated formulas and provide a revised version of the function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    // If the left side is FALSE or the right side is TRUE, implication is TRUE\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE)\n        return this.verum();\n    \n    // If the left side is TRUE, the result is the right side of the implication\n    if (left.type() == TRUE)\n        return right;\n    \n    // If the right side is FALSE, the result is the negation of the left side\n    if (right.type() == FALSE)\n        return this.not(left);\n    \n    // If left and right are equivalent, implication is TRUE\n    if (left.equals(right))\n        return this.verum();\n    \n    // If left is the negation of right, implication is FALSE\n    if (left.negate().equals(right))\n        return this.falsum(); // Corrected this logic\n    \n    // Use caching for implications\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Corrected the condition where `left.negate().equals(right)` to return `this.falsum()` which represents FALSE.\n\nThis should address the issues identified in the test cases.",
