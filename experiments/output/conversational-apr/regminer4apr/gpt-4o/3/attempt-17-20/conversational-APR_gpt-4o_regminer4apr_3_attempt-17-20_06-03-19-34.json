In propositional logic, the implication \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is equivalent to \\( \\lnot A \\lor B \\). The function is supposed to handle various special cases and ensure that the correct implication is returned based on the input formulas. Let's review the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Logical Implication Basics**: \n   - If the left side (antecedent) is `FALSE`, the implication is always `TRUE` because `FALSE` implies anything.\n   - If the right side (consequent) is `TRUE`, the implication is also `TRUE` because anything implies `TRUE`.\n   - If the left side is `TRUE`, the implication's truth is dependent solely on the right side, so we return the right side.\n   - If the right side is `FALSE`, the implication is the negation of the left side because the only way for the implication to be `FALSE` is if the antecedent is `TRUE`.\n\n2. **Handling Special Cases**:\n   - If both sides are equal, the implication should be `TRUE` since \\( A \\rightarrow A \\) is always `TRUE`.\n   - If the left side is the negation of the right side, the implication is the same as the right side because the implication \\( \\lnot A \\rightarrow A \\) is equivalent to `TRUE`.\n\n3. **Caching Implications**:\n   - Use a cache to store previously computed implications to avoid recomputation.\n\nWith these points in mind, let's correct the function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE) {\n        return this.verum();  // FALSE implies anything or anything implies TRUE\n    }\n    if (left.type() == TRUE) {\n        return right;  // TRUE implies right\n    }\n    if (right.type() == FALSE) {\n        return this.not(left);  // Left implies FALSE is equivalent to NOT left\n    }\n    if (left.equals(right)) {\n        return this.verum();  // A implies A is TRUE\n    }\n    if (left.equals(right.negate())) {\n        return right;  // NOT A implies A is the same as A\n    }\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version should address the logical errors and handle all edge cases.
