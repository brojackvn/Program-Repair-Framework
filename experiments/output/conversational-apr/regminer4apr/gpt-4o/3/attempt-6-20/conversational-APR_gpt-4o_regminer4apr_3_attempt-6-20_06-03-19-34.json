        "response": "To address the issues in the `implication` method, let's examine the logic step by step and make necessary adjustments:\n\n1. **Understanding Implication Logic**: \n   - In classical logic, the implication `A ⇒ B` is equivalent to `¬A ∨ B`. \n   - It is true when:\n     - `A` is false (regardless of `B`).\n     - `B` is true (regardless of `A`).\n   - It is false only when `A` is true and `B` is false.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Current Implementation**:\n   - The current implementation checks if `left` is `FALSE` or `right` is `TRUE`, in which case the implication is true (`verum`).\n   - If `left` is `TRUE`, the result should simply be `right`.\n   - If `right` is `FALSE`, the result should be `¬left`.\n   - If `left` and `right` are equal, the implication is true (`verum`).\n   - If `left` is the negation of `right`, the implication should be `right`.\n\n3. **Identifying Issues**:\n   - The current condition `if (left.negate().equals(right))` returning `left.negate()` seems incorrect. Instead, it should return `right` since `A ⇒ ¬A` should be equivalent to `¬A`.\n   - Ensure `this.verum()` and `this.not()` are correctly implemented to return a true formula and a negated formula, respectively.\n\n4. **Code Revision**:\n   - Let's correct and simplify the logic to match the classical implication.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    // Implication logic: A ⇒ B is equivalent to ¬A ∨ B\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE) {\n        return this.verum();\n    }\n    if (left.type() == TRUE) {\n        return right;\n    }\n    if (right.type() == FALSE) {\n        return this.not(left);\n    }\n    if (left.equals(right)) {\n        return this.verum();\n    }\n    if (left.negate().equals(right)) {\n        return right;\n    }\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- This version uses the same checks but corrects the handling of the negation case.\n- It also maintains the caching mechanism for implications, ensuring efficient retrieval or creation of the `Implication` object.\n\nMake sure that the helper methods such as `verum()`, `not()`, and the `Implication` constructor are implemented correctly elsewhere in your codebase to support these operations.",
