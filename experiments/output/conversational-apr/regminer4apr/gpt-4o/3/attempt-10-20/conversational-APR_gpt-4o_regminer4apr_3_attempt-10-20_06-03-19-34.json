        "response": "To address the issues in the `implication` function, let's carefully analyze the logic and conditions that determine the behavior of the implication operation. The implication operation (`A → B`) in logic can be defined using the following rules:\n\n1. If the left formula `A` is `FALSE`, the implication is always `TRUE` regardless of `B` (i.e., `FALSE → B` is `TRUE`).\n2. If the right formula `B` is `TRUE`, the implication is always `TRUE` regardless of `A` (i.e., `A → TRUE` is `TRUE`).\n3. If the left formula `A` is `TRUE`, the implication is equivalent to `B` (i.e., `TRUE → B` is `B`).\n4. If the right formula `B` is `FALSE`, the implication is equivalent to `¬A` (i.e., `A → FALSE` is `¬A`).\n5. If `A` equals `B`, the implication is `TRUE` (i.e., `A → A` is `TRUE`).\n6. If `A` is the negation of `B`, the implication is `¬B` (i.e., `A → ¬A` is `¬A`).\n\nGiven the error message you provided and the typical logical rules, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misimplementation of these logical conditions. Let's correct the function by ensuring the conditions properly align with the logical rules for implication:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE) {\n        return this.verum();\n    }\n    if (left.type() == TRUE) {\n        return right;\n    }\n    if (right.type() == FALSE) {\n        return this.not(left);\n    }\n    if (left.equals(right)) {\n        return this.verum();\n    }\n    if (left.negate().equals(right)) {\n        return right;  // Corrected to return right instead of left.negate()\n    }\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Corrected the return in the condition `if (left.negate().equals(right))` to `return right;` instead of `return left.negate();`. This addresses a possible misunderstanding of the logical condition where `A` is the negation of `B`.\n\nThese changes should ensure that the function behaves according to the logical rules of implication and should address the error encountered in the test case.
