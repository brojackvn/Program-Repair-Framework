        "response": "To fix the bugs in the `fillOutputRow` function, we need to ensure that the `outputRow` array is always large enough to accommodate the elements of the input `row`. Additionally, we need to make sure that we are accessing valid indexes in both `outputRow` and `row`.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the `fillOutputRow` function:\n\n```java\n@Override\nprivate <T> void fillOutputRow(T[] row) {\n    if (row.length > outputRow.length) {\n        outputRow = Arrays.copyOf(row, row.length);\n    } else {\n        System.arraycopy(row, 0, outputRow, 0, row.length);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of changes made:\n1. We no longer check for `columnReorderingEnabled` as it does not affect the logic of copying elements from `row` to `outputRow`.\n2. We always ensure that `outputRow` is at least as large as `row` by copying the elements of `row` into `outputRow` using `Arrays.copyOf` or `System.arraycopy`.\n3. There is no need for `indexesToWrite` array checks as we are copying all elements from `row` to `outputRow`.\n\nPlease replace the existing `fillOutputRow` function with the corrected version above and run your test cases again to verify that the issues have been resolved.",
