Here is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\nfinal void reset() {\n    this.columnsToExtractInitialized = false;\n    this.currentRecord = 0;\n    this.column = 0;\n    this.headers = null;\n    this.recordToExtract = null; // Added initialization for recordToExtract variable\n}\n```\n\nIn the corrected version, I have added initialization for the `recordToExtract` variable which seems to be missing in the original function. This should help resolve the issues you are facing with the test cases.",
