Here is the corrected version of the `finish()` method:\n\n```java\npublic void finish() throws IOException {\n    if (!closed) {\n        closed = true;\n        try {\n            if (this.runLength > 0) {\n                writeRun();\n            }\n            this.currentChar = -1;\n            endBlock();\n            endCompression();\n        } finally {\n            if (this.out != null) {\n                this.out.flush();\n                this.out.close();\n            }\n            this.out = null;\n            this.blockSorter = null;\n            this.data = null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, we have added the flushing and closing of the output stream (`out`) before setting it to `null`. This ensures that any buffered data is properly written to the stream and that the stream is closed before cleaning up resources.\n\nPlease replace the existing `finish()` method with this corrected version and test the code again to verify that the error has been resolved.",
