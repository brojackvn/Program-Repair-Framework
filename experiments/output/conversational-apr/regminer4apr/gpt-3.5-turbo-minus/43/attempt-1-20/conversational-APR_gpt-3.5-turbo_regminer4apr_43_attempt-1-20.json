To fix this issue, you need to ensure that `val` is properly initialized before returning its value.\n\nHere is an updated version of the `getValue` method that initializes `val` to an empty string if it is null:\n\n```java\npublic String getValue() {\n    if (val == null) {\n        val = \"\";\n    }\n    return val;\n}\n```\n\nBy adding this null check and initializing `val` to an empty string if it is null, you can prevent the NullPointerException from occurring and address the issue with the failing test case.",
