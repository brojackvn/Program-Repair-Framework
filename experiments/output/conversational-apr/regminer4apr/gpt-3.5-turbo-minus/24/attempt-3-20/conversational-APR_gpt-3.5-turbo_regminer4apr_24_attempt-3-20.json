One potential issue could be that the `input` stream is not being closed in case an exception is thrown when closing the `output` stream. To address this, you can use try-with-resources to ensure that both streams are closed properly. Here is the updated function:\n\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    IOException exception = null;\n    try (InputStream inputStream = this.input; OutputStream outputStream = this.output) {\n        // No need to explicitly close the input and output streams here\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        exception = e;\n    }\n    if (exception != null) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code uses try-with-resources to automatically close the input and output streams when they go out of scope. It also catches any IOException that occurs during the closing of the streams and rethrows it after the try block is executed. This should ensure that both streams are closed properly and any exceptions are handled correctly.",
