        "response": "The bug-inducing changes introduced a conditional block that checks if `headers` is `null` and then attempts to set headers from either `headerMapping` or `rowData`. Additionally, if `isHeaderWritingEnabled` is true and `recordCount` is zero, it attempts to write headers to the `outputList`. The introduced logic seems to interfere with the existing logic and causes the failure in the test case.\n\n### Steps to Identify the Root Cause:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The method `writeRows` is responsible for writing rows of data to an output list or processing them using a row processor. It takes headers from either `headerMapping` or `rowData`.\n\n2. **Analyzing Bug-Inducing Changes**: \n   - The added block sets headers when `headers` is `null`. This seems correct, but it might be interfering with how headers are managed elsewhere.\n   - The conditional check for writing headers (`isHeaderWritingEnabled && recordCount == 0`) might not align well with the current logic of handling headers.\n\n3. **Identifying the Issue**: \n   - The problem might be that headers are being set or written in a context where they are not expected or needed, causing an inconsistency in how headers and rows are processed.\n   - The logic of when headers should be written and how they should be initialized might have been altered in a way that leads to errors when processing maps.\n\n4. **Proposed Fix**: \n   - Ensure that headers are only set and written when it is contextually appropriate. \n   - Refactor the logic to avoid redundant or conflicting operations with headers.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate <K, I extends Iterable<?>> void writeRows(Map<K, String> headerMapping, Map<K, I> rowData, List<String> outputList, boolean useRowProcessor) {\n    try {\n        Iterator[] iterators = new Iterator[rowData.size()];\n        Object[] keys = new Object[rowData.size()];\n        final Map<Object, Object> rowValues = new LinkedHashMap<Object, Object>(rowData.size());\n\n        int length = 0;\n        for (Map.Entry<K, I> rowEntry : rowData.entrySet()) {\n            iterators[length] = rowEntry.getValue() == null ? null : rowEntry.getValue().iterator();\n            keys[length] = rowEntry.getKey();\n            rowValues.put(rowEntry.getKey(), null);\n            length++;\n        }\n\n        boolean nullsOnly;\n\n        do {\n            nullsOnly = true;\n            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n                Iterator<?> iterator = iterators[i];\n                boolean isNull = iterator == null || !iterator.hasNext();\n                nullsOnly &= isNull;\n                if (isNull) {\n                    rowValues.put(keys[i], null);\n                } else {\n                    rowValues.put(keys[i], iterator.next());\n                }\n            }\n            if (!nullsOnly) {\n                if (outputList == null) {\n                    if (useRowProcessor) {\n                        processRecord((Map) headerMapping, (Map) rowValues);\n                    } else {\n                        writeRow((Map) headerMapping, (Map) rowValues);\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    if (useRowProcessor) {\n                        outputList.add(processRecordToString((Map) headerMapping, (Map) rowValues));\n                    } else {\n                        outputList.add(writeRowToString((Map) headerMapping, (Map) rowValues));\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        } while (!nullsOnly);\n    } catch (Throwable t) {\n        throw throwExceptionAndClose(\"Error processing input rows from map\", t);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Removed the block that prematurely sets headers and writes them to the output list. This ensures headers are handled as per the original logic without any unintended side effects.\n- The headers should be managed and written according to the existing workflow, which might be handled elsewhere in the code. Hence, the bug-inducing block was removed to restore correct functionality.",
