        "response": "To address the problem, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functionality**: The `close()` method is designed to close two streams: `input` and `output`. The method calls `close()` on both `input` and `output`, which is a common pattern for cleaning up resources.\n\n2. **Review the Error Message**: The error message indicates that there is a problem with the method `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed`, which is failing because something that was expected to be `false` is actually `true`. This suggests that a stream is being closed when it shouldn't be.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Commit Message**: The commit message mentions a merge with `__rultor`, but doesn't give explicit details about the changes. However, given that there are no direct changes in the `close()` method itself, the bug is likely due to changes in related code that affect how or when streams are closed.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Context**: The problem likely arises from the behavior of the `input` stream. The test `leftInputUnclosed` suggests that the `input` stream should remain open after certain operations, which isn't happening due to the current implementation of `close()`.\n\n5. **Identifying the Root Cause**: The root cause is likely that the `input` stream should not be closed in the `close()` method, as indicated by the failing test case. The `output` stream should be closed, but the `input` stream should remain open to avoid interfering with its use elsewhere in the program.\n\n6. **Fixing the Problem**: Modify the `close()` method to only close the `output` stream, leaving the `input` stream open.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    // Only close the output stream, leave the input stream open\n    this.output.close();\n}\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the `input` stream remains open, which should satisfy the condition expected by the failing test case `leftInputUnclosed`.",

Based on the error messages from the failing test cases, it seems that some streams are being closed when they should not be. Specifically, the test `leftInputUnclosed` suggests that the input stream should remain open, but it is being closed.\n\nThis indicates that the `close` method might need to be modified to ensure that only certain streams are closed, or that the closing behavior is conditional.\n\nHere's how the `close` method can be modified to address these issues:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    // Only close the output stream, leave the input stream open\n    // This assumes that the design requires the input stream to remain open\n    this.output.close();\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Stream Handling**: The test `leftInputUnclosed` indicates that the input stream should not be closed. Therefore, we remove the `this.input.close()` call.\n\n2. **Output Stream Handling**: The output stream is closed as it seems to be the intended behavior that remains unchallenged by the test cases.\n\n3. **Conditional Closure**: If there are specific conditions or flags that dictate when an input or output should be closed, further logic should be added to handle those cases appropriately. However, based on the current information, the simplest fix is to only close the output stream.\n\nThis adjustment should address the test cases by ensuring that the input stream remains open as expected in the tests. If further conditions are required, those should be added based on additional context from the usage of these streams in the application.",

Specifically, the failing test cases indicate that the left input stream is being closed when it should remain open. This implies that the `close` method is not handling the resources correctly, particularly with respect to the context in which they should be closed.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to ensure that only the resources that are supposed to be closed are actually closed, and those that should remain open, remain so. One possible solution is to introduce conditional checks to determine whether a stream should be closed.\n\nHere's how you might modify the `close` method to handle this:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    try {\n        if (this.input != null && shouldCloseInput) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        if (this.output != null && shouldCloseOutput) {\n            this.output.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Assuming you have flags or a context to determine whether the input and output should be closed.\nprivate boolean shouldCloseInput;\nprivate boolean shouldCloseOutput;\n```\n\nIn this modification:\n\n- I've added `shouldCloseInput` and `shouldCloseOutput` flags to determine whether each resource should be closed. These flags should be set based on the context in which the streams are used.\n- The `try` block ensures that the input stream is closed only if it should be.\n- The `finally` block guarantees that the output stream is closed, ensuring resource cleanup even if an exception occurs when closing the input.\n\nYou will need to ensure that `shouldCloseInput` and `shouldCloseOutput` are correctly managed wherever the class is used, so that they reflect the intended behavior in different contexts. This might involve setting these flags when the streams are initialized or based on additional parameters passed to the class.",

Let's modify the method accordingly and add the necessary fields:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.Closeable;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class TeeInputStream implements Closeable {\n\n    private final InputStream input;\n    private final OutputStream output;\n    private final boolean shouldCloseInput;\n    private final boolean shouldCloseOutput;\n\n    public TeeInputStream(InputStream input, OutputStream output, boolean shouldCloseInput, boolean shouldCloseOutput) {\n        this.input = input;\n        this.output = output;\n        this.shouldCloseInput = shouldCloseInput;\n        this.shouldCloseOutput = shouldCloseOutput;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void close() throws IOException {\n        if (this.shouldCloseInput) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n        if (this.shouldCloseOutput) {\n            this.output.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Flags for Closing**: Added `shouldCloseInput` and `shouldCloseOutput` boolean flags to determine whether the input and output streams should be closed.\n2. **Constructor**: These flags are set via the constructor, allowing the caller to specify the desired behavior.\n3. **Close Method**: The `close()` method now respects these flags, closing the streams only when specified.\n\n### Usage:\n- When creating an instance of `TeeInputStream`, you can specify whether the input and/or output streams should be closed by passing `true` or `false` for `shouldCloseInput` and `shouldCloseOutput`, respectively.\n\nThis setup allows for flexible handling of stream closure, preventing the issues seen in the failing test cases.",
