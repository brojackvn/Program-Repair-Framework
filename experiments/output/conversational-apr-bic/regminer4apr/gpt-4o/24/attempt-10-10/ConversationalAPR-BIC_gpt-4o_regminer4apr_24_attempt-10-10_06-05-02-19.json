The failing test `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed` suggests that the input stream should not be closed prematurely. This may indicate that the function is closing streams that shouldn't be closed at this point, or that additional logic is needed to determine when each stream should be closed.\n\nThe main issue seems to be that closing both `input` and `output` unconditionally is causing problems. Instead, we should handle each stream independently and possibly introduce logic to avoid closing streams that should remain open.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function with added logic to handle closing streams carefully:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    // Only close the output stream if it's not null and needs to be closed\n    if (this.output != null) {\n        this.output.close();\n    }\n    // Only close the input stream if it's not null and should be closed\n    if (this.input != null) {\n        // Add logic to determine whether the input should be closed\n        // This could be based on a flag or context-specific condition\n        if (shouldCloseInput()) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example method to determine whether the input should be closed\nprivate boolean shouldCloseInput() {\n    // Implement your logic here. For example, it could be a flag\n    // or some condition based on the current context.\n    return false; // Placeholder return value\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation introduces a method `shouldCloseInput()` to determine whether the input stream should be closed. The actual logic will need to be determined based on the specific requirements or context in which the streams are used. Adjust this logic as necessary to suit the application's needs and ensure that tests pass successfully.",
