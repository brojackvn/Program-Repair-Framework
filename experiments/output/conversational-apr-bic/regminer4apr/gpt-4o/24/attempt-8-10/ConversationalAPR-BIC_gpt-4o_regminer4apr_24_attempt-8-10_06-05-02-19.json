This implies that the test expects `input` to remain open.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Bug-Inducing Commit Message**:\n   - The commit message \"Merge branch '__rultor'\" does not provide specific details, but it indicates a merge. Merges can often introduce changes that are not immediately visible in the code being inspected.\n\n3. **Identifying the Problem**:\n   - The test failure indicates that closing the `input` stream is incorrect or not expected in this context.\n   - The bug-inducing changes might have introduced a requirement or a convention where `input` should not be closed by this method.\n\n4. **Solution**:\n   - If the requirement is to ensure that the `input` stream remains open, we need to modify the `close()` method to only close the `output` stream.\n\n5. **Providing the Correct Function**:\n   - Modify the `close()` method to only close the `output` stream.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    // this.input.close(); // Commented out to avoid closing the input stream\n    this.output.close();\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- By commenting out `this.input.close();`, we ensure that the `input` stream remains open, which aligns with the expectations set by the failing test case. The `output` stream is still closed as it seems to be the intended behavior.",

The test cases suggest that the input stream should not necessarily be closed when the `close` method is invoked, which is not the current behavior. Let's fix this:\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe current implementation of the `close` method closes both the input and output streams unconditionally. However, some use cases might require only the output stream to be closed, while the input stream remains open. This behavior is indicated by the test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed`, which expects the input stream to remain unclosed.\n\n### Solution\nWe need to modify the `close` method to conditionally close the input stream based on some criteria or context. Here's a revised version of the `close` method that only closes the output stream:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    // Close the output stream as per the requirement\n    this.output.close();\n    // The input stream is intentionally not closed to satisfy the test case expectations\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Output Stream Closure**: The output stream is closed to ensure that any buffered data is flushed and resources are released.\n- **Input Stream**: The input stream is not closed in this implementation, aligning with test expectations that indicate it should remain open.\n\nThis approach provides a more flexible resource management strategy, avoiding the premature closure of the input stream unless explicitly required by a specific context or use case.",

The test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed` is expecting that the input stream is not closed after certain operations, but the current implementation closes both the input and output streams in the `close` method.\n\nTo fix this, we should ensure that only the output stream is closed by default, leaving the input stream open unless explicitly specified.

However, based on the test cases and errors, it appears that there are scenarios where the input stream should not be closed, such as in `TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed`. This suggests that the lifecycle management of the streams is not being handled correctly.\n\nTo address this issue, we should close only the streams that are meant to be closed when the `close` method is invoked. This may mean that we need to refactor the `close` method to make it conditional, possibly driven by flags or by the design of the class, to determine which streams should be closed.\n\nHere's a revised version of the `close` method that provides more control over which streams to close:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (this.shouldCloseInput) {\n        this.input.close();\n    }\n    if (this.shouldCloseOutput) {\n        this.output.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `shouldCloseInput` and `shouldCloseOutput` are hypothetical boolean fields that would be set based on the desired behavior for each use case of this class. You would need to ensure that these flags are properly initialized elsewhere in the code, perhaps through a constructor or setter methods, to reflect the intended lifecycle management for the input and output streams.\n\nThis approach allows for more flexibility and can be adjusted to the specific needs of different scenarios, such as those described in your test cases.",

The original method simply closes both streams unconditionally, but the test cases suggest that there are situations where the input stream should not be closed.\n\nThe failing test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed` indicates that the input stream should remain open under some conditions. To fix this, we need to modify the `close()` method to conditionally close the streams based on some flags or conditions. These conditions are likely determined by the context in which the streams are used.\n\nHere's how you might implement such a solution:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class StreamHandler implements AutoCloseable {\n    private final AutoCloseable input;\n    private final AutoCloseable output;\n    private final boolean shouldCloseInput;\n    private final boolean shouldCloseOutput;\n\n    public StreamHandler(AutoCloseable input, AutoCloseable output, boolean shouldCloseInput, boolean shouldCloseOutput) {\n        this.input = input;\n        this.output = output;\n        this.shouldCloseInput = shouldCloseInput;\n        this.shouldCloseOutput = shouldCloseOutput;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void close() throws IOException {\n        try {\n            if (this.shouldCloseInput) {\n                this.input.close();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            throw new IOException(\"Failed to close input stream\", e);\n        }\n\n        try {\n            if (this.shouldCloseOutput) {\n                this.output.close();\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            throw new IOException(\"Failed to close output stream\", e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flags for Closing**: We introduce two boolean flags `shouldCloseInput` and `shouldCloseOutput`. These flags determine whether the input or output streams should be closed when `close()` is called. The flags can be set based on the context in which the `StreamHandler` is used.\n\n- **Conditional Closing**: The `close()` method checks these flags before attempting to close the streams. This allows for more flexible control over the resource management, ensuring that we only close the streams when appropriate.\n\n- **Exception Handling**: We wrap the `close()` calls in try-catch blocks to handle any `IOException` that may occur while closing the streams. This ensures that any exceptions are caught and appropriately wrapped or logged.\n\nThis approach should make the code more robust and pass the test cases that expect the input stream to remain open under certain conditions.",
