        "response": "To address the issue, we need to analyze the bug-inducing commit message and the failed test case. The commit message \"Normalize invisibles in text()\" suggests that invisible characters are being normalized, but the function `isInvisibleChar` is responsible for detecting such characters.\n\nThe error message from the failing test `org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest#doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` indicates that the function incorrectly identifies some invisible characters, leading to unexpected deletions or transformations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Character Types**: The function checks for a specific character type (`Character.getType(c) == 16`). The type `16` corresponds to `FORMAT` characters, which include more than the ones explicitly checked in the function. However, the function is looking for specific invisible characters: zero-width space (8203), zero-width non-joiner (8204), zero-width joiner (8205), and soft hyphen (173).\n\n2. **Test Case Failure**: The test case failure suggests that some invisible characters, specifically the zero-width joiner (ZWJ, 8205), should not be removed or treated as invisible in the context it is being used. This implies that the function is incorrectly marking ZWJ as an \"invisible\" character for purposes beyond mere detection.\n\n3. **Corrective Measure**: Based on the test case's expectation, we should adjust our function to exclude ZWJ from being treated as a character that should be normalized or removed.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo correct the function, we should modify the logic to ensure that while we detect these characters, we do not consider ZWJ (8205) as an \"invisible\" character to normalize or remove.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Check if the character is one of the specific invisible characters except ZWJ\n    return Character.getType(c) == 16 && (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 173);\n    // Exclude ZWJ (8205) from the list of characters to be considered \"invisible\" for normalization\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We have removed `c == 8205` from the condition, as the ZWJ should not be considered an \"invisible\" character for normalization purposes in the context of the failing test case.\n- This change aligns with the expected behavior described by the failing test, ensuring that ZWJ remains unchanged during normalization processes.",
