        "response": "To identify the root cause of the regression bug in the `popStackToClose` function, let's analyze the change and its implications:\n\n### Change Analysis\n\nThe change in the bug-inducing commit modified the way the end tag's name is accessed:\n\n- Original code: `String elName = endTag.name();`\n- Changed code: `String elName = endTag.normalName();`\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`endTag.name()`**: This method would typically return the tag name as it appears in the source document. The case (upper or lower) is preserved.\n\n2. **`endTag.normalName()`**: This method returns a normalized version of the tag name, often converted to lowercase, especially in XML parsing modes where case normalization is applied.\n\n### Problem\n\nWhen parsing XML, case preservation is crucial because XML is case-sensitive. Changing from `name()` to `normalName()` results in converting tag names to lowercase, which can lead to mismatches when trying to close the stack of elements.\n\n### Error Explanation\n\nThe failing test case indicates that the structure of the parsed XML doesn't match the expected structure due to incorrect handling of tag names. Specifically, the tags were being mismatched because the normalization (lowercasing) was causing the `popStackToClose` function to fail in identifying the correct elements to close.\n\n### Solution\n\nRevert the change to use `endTag.name()` to ensure case preservation while matching tag names, which is essential for XML parsing.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate void popStackToClose(Token.EndTag endTag) {\n    String elName = endTag.name(); // Revert to using name() for case-sensitive match\n    Element firstFound = null;\n\n    for (int pos = stack.size() - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {\n        Element next = stack.get(pos);\n        if (next.nodeName().equals(elName)) {\n            firstFound = next;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (firstFound == null)\n        return; // not found, skip\n\n    for (int pos = stack.size() - 1; pos >= 0; pos--) {\n        Element next = stack.get(pos);\n        stack.remove(pos);\n        if (next == firstFound)\n            break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThe key to fixing the bug is to ensure that the tag name comparison retains the original case sensitivity, as required in XML parsing. By using `endTag.name()`, we align with the expected behavior of case-sensitive matching, resolving the regression issue.",

The regression issue arises because the function was altered to use `normalName()`, causing it to incorrectly handle case-sensitive tags in XML parsing.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo fix the regression bug while preserving the intended functionality, we need to revert to using `endTag.name()` when dealing with environments where case sensitivity matters, such as XML parsing.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate void popStackToClose(Token.EndTag endTag) {\n    String elName = endTag.name(); // Use the case-sensitive name for XML\n\n    Element firstFound = null;\n\n    for (int pos = stack.size() -1; pos >= 0; pos--) {\n        Element next = stack.get(pos);\n        if (next.nodeName().equals(elName)) {\n            firstFound = next;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (firstFound == null)\n        return; // not found, skip\n\n    for (int pos = stack.size() -1; pos >= 0; pos--) {\n        Element next = stack.get(pos);\n        stack.remove(pos);\n        if (next == firstFound)\n            break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reverted to `endTag.name()`:** We reverted the change to use `endTag.name()` to respect case sensitivity required in XML parsing. This ensures that tags are closed correctly based on their original case-sensitive names.\n- **Preserved Original Logic:** The rest of the function logic is preserved to ensure that the stack is managed correctly as per the original design intentions.\n\nThis fix should address the issues with case sensitivity in XML parsing while maintaining the desired behavior for HTML parsing.",

Specifically, the bug-inducing change was made to normalize tag names, which can cause discrepancies when the case sensitivity of the tag names is important.
