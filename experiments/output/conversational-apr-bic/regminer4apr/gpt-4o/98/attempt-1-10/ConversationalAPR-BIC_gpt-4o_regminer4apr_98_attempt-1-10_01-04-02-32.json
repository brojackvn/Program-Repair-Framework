However, this is problematic because returning `EOF` (which likely is `-1`) from the `available()` method contradicts its intended behavior. The `available()` method should not return `EOF` to indicate that no bytes are available; instead, it should return `0`.\n\n3. **Correct Behavior**: The method should correctly calculate the number of available bytes without modifying the stream's state prematurely.\n\n4. **Resolution Strategy**: The `refill()` method should not affect the `available()` method's behavior unless it is a part of determining the current buffer state. If `refill()` is necessary to ensure the buffer is populated, it should be called, but the `available()` method should return `0` when no bytes are available instead of `EOF`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic synchronized int available() throws IOException {\n    // Attempt to refill the buffer if necessary\n    refill();\n    \n    // Return the number of bytes that can be read without blocking\n    return byteBuffer.remaining();\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Remove Early Return**: We removed the early return of `EOF` from the method. Instead, we let `refill()` attempt to fill the buffer, but we don't prematurely return `EOF`.\n\n- **Consistent Return**: The method now consistently returns the number of bytes available to be read without blocking. If `refill()` fails to add more bytes to the buffer, `byteBuffer.remaining()` will naturally return `0`, which is the correct value when no bytes are available to read.\n\nThis approach ensures that the `available()` method adheres to its contract and returns the correct number of available bytes.",

If it returns `false`, it indicates that no more data can be loaded (e.g., end of file has been reached).\n\n4. **Expectation from `available()`**: Even if `refill()` returns `false`, the `available()` method should still return the number of bytes that are currently available in the buffer, not `EOF`.\n\n5. **Correction Strategy**: Instead of returning `EOF` directly when `refill()` returns `false`, we should ensure that we always return the number of bytes remaining in the buffer.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic synchronized int available() throws IOException {\n    refill(); // Attempt to refill, but don't return EOF if it fails\n    return byteBuffer.remaining(); // Always return the bytes remaining in the buffer\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We attempt to `refill()` the buffer to load more data if possible. \n- Regardless of whether `refill()` is successful or not, the key point is to return the number of bytes that are currently in the buffer (`byteBuffer.remaining()`).\n- This ensures that `available()` always reflects the accurate number of bytes that can be read without blocking, aligning with the expected behavior of the method.",
