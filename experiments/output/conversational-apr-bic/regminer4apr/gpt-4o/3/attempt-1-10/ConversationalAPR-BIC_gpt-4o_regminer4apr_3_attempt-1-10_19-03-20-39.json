        "response": "The bug was introduced by the following lines:\n\n```java\nif (left.negate().equals(right))\n  return left.negate();\n```\n\nThese lines were added as a new simplification step in the implication function. However, they are causing the errors in the test cases because they incorrectly simplify the implication when `left.negate().equals(right)`.\n\nIn logic, an implication `A -> B` is equivalent to `!A OR B`. The simplification being introduced here does not hold correctly for all logical cases and is causing the implication to return incorrect results.\n\nLet's remove this incorrect simplification to restore the previous correct behavior of the implication method. Here's the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE)\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.type() == TRUE)\n        return right;\n    if (right.type() == FALSE)\n        return this.not(left);\n    if (left.equals(right))\n        return this.verum();\n    // Remove the incorrect simplification\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\nThe key change is the removal of the lines:\n\n```java\nif (left.negate().equals(right))\n    return left.negate();\n```\n\nBy removing this, we ensure that the implication function respects the correct logical equivalences without introducing incorrect simplifications. This should resolve the test failures as expected.",
