However, based on the failing test case \"org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed: java.lang.AssertionError: Expected : <false>\", it seems that the bug is related to not properly closing the input stream.\n\nGiven that the test case is checking if the left input stream is closed, the bug may be that the input stream is not being closed in the `close()` method of the class where the method is located.\n\nTo fix this bug, we should ensure that both the input stream and output stream are properly closed in the `close()` method. Here is the corrected version of the `close()` method:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    try {\n        if (this.input != null) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        if (this.output != null) {\n            this.output.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version of the `close()` method first checks if the input stream is not null before attempting to close it. It also ensures that the output stream is always closed, regardless of whether the input stream was successfully closed or not.",
