This merge operation may have introduced changes that led to the bug in the `close()` function.\n\nGiven that the error message mentions a test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed` failing due to an assertion error related to an input not being closed, it is likely that the bug in the `close()` function is related to not properly closing the input stream.\n\nTo fix this issue, we should ensure that the input stream is closed before closing the output stream in the `close()` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    try {\n        if (this.input != null) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        if (this.output != null) {\n            this.output.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version of the function checks if the input stream is not null before attempting to close it, and ensures that both the input and output streams are closed properly.
