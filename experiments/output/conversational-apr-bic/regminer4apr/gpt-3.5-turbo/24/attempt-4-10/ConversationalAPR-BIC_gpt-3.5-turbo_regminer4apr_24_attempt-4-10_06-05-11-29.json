The failing test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed` is related to input streams not being properly closed.\n\n### Analysis and Solution:\n1. The bug-inducing commit message suggests that changes from the `__rultor` branch were merged.\n2. The failing test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed` indicates that the left input stream is not properly closed after usage.\n3. The bug in the provided `close()` method is that it closes the `input` and `output` streams, but does not ensure that any input stream passed to it is closed.\n\n### Revised `close()` Method:\nTo address the root cause and fix the regression bug, we need to update the `close()` method to ensure that any input stream passed to it is properly closed. Here's the revised implementation:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    try {\n        if (this.input != null) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        if (this.output != null) {\n            this.output.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy explicitly checking and closing the `input` stream within a try-with-resources block, we ensure that all resources are properly closed, addressing the regression bug identified in the failing test case.",
