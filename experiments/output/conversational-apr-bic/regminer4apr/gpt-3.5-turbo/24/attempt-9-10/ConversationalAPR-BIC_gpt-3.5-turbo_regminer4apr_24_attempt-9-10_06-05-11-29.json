        "response": "Based on the bug-inducing commit message which states \"Merge branch '__rultor'\", it seems that the bug was introduced during a merge operation from a branch named '__rultor'. This merge might have introduced changes that led to the regression bug in the `close` method.\n\nConsidering the failing test case `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed`, it is clear that the issue is related to the `close` method not properly closing resources.\n\nTo fix this bug, the `close` method should be modified to ensure that both `input` and `output` resources are closed properly, even if an exception occurs during the closing of one of the resources. One common approach is to use try-with-resources to automatically close the resources:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    Exception exception = null;\n    try {\n        if (this.input != null) {\n            this.input.close();\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        exception = e;\n    }\n    try {\n        if (this.output != null) {\n            this.output.close();\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        if (exception != null) {\n            exception.addSuppressed(e);\n        } else {\n            exception = e;\n        }\n    }\n    if (exception != null) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Error occurred while closing resources\", exception);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis updated `close` method ensures that both `input` and `output` resources are attempted to be closed and any exceptions that occur during closing are properly handled.",
