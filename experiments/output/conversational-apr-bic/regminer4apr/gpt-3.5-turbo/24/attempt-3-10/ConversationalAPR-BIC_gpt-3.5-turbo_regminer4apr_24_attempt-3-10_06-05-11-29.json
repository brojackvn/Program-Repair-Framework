This merge could have introduced changes that led to the bug in the `close()` method.\n\n2. **Failing Test Case Error Message:** The error message `org.cactoos.io.TeeInputStreamTest#leftInputUnclosed: java.lang.AssertionError: Expected : <false>` indicates that the test `leftInputUnclosed` is failing because it expected the left input stream to be closed, but it was not closed.\n\n3. **Potential Issue:** Since the test expects the left input stream to be closed, but it is not closed in the `close()` method, the bug could be related to not properly closing the input stream.\n\n### Regression Fix:\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `this.input` and `this.output` are closed properly in the `close()` method. Here is the corrected function:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (this.input != null) {\n        this.input.close();\n    }\n    if (this.output != null) {\n        this.output.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe bug in the `close()` method was caused by changes introduced in a merge commit which likely affected the proper closing of input and output streams. The regression fix ensures that both streams are closed correctly to prevent the failing test case.",
