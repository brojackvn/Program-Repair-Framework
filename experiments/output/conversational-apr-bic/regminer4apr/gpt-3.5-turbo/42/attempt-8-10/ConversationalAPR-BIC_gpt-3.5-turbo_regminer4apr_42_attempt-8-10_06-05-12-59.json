        "response": "To identify the root cause of the bug introduced by the mentioned commit message \"Normalize invisibles in text()\", we need to understand the context and implications of normalizing invisibles in text.\n\nGiven the failing test case `org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest#doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText`, we can infer that the normalization of invisibles in text caused an issue related to Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ) characters.\n\nThe failing test case `doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` suggests that the normalization process incorrectly removed or modified ZWJ characters, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to adjust the `isInvisibleChar` function to correctly handle ZWJ characters. ZWJ characters should not be considered invisible in this context.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return Character.getType(c) == 16 && (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 173);\n    // zero width sp, zw non join, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\nBy removing the ZWJ character (8205) from the condition, we ensure that ZWJ characters are not mistakenly classified as invisible characters. This adjustment should address the issue caused by the normalization changes introduced in the bug-inducing commit.",
