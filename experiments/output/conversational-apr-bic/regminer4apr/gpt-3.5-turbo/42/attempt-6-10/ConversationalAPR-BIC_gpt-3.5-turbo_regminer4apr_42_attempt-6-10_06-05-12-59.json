        "response": "### Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. **Bug-Inducing Changes**:\n   - The bug-inducing commit message mentions normalizing invisibles in text. This suggests that there might have been changes related to text normalization that introduced the bug in the `isInvisibleChar` function.\n\n2. **Failing Test Case**:\n   - The failing test case `ElementTest#doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` indicates that normalization of text is involved in the bug, specifically related to the zero-width join character (`ZWJ`).\n\n3. **Relation to `isInvisibleChar` Function**:\n   - The `isInvisibleChar` function checks for invisible characters based on their type and specific character codes. The failing test case error message suggests that the normalization process might be altering the behavior of the function for the zero-width join character (`ZWJ`).\n\n### Proposed Fix\n\nGiven the context of text normalization and the failing test case related to the zero-width join character, it seems that the normalization process might be changing the character code of `ZWJ`, causing the `isInvisibleChar` function to incorrectly classify it as an invisible character.\n\nTo address this issue, we can update the `isInvisibleChar` function to specifically handle the zero-width join character (`ZWJ`) separately, ensuring that its identification as an invisible character is accurate.\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return Character.getType(c) == 16 && (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173 || c == 8206);\n    // zero width sp, zw non join, zw join, soft hyphen, zw join\n}\n```\n\nBy adding `c == 8206` to the condition, we include the zero-width join character (`ZWJ`) in the check for invisible characters, addressing the issue caused by the normalization process and fixing the bug.",

Let's analyze the issue and correct the function accordingly.\n\nGiven the error message:\nError 1: org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest#doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText: java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<12> but was:<10>\n\nThe failing test case `doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` suggests that the normalization process is not handling zero-width joiner (ZWJ) characters correctly. The error indicates that the expected count of characters after normalization is 12, but the actual count is 10. This implies that the ZWJ characters are being incorrectly removed during normalization.\n\nTo fix the function `isInvisibleChar`, we should include the ZWJ character (U+200D) in the condition to ensure it is not treated as an invisible character and is retained during normalization.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return Character.getType(c) == 16 && (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173 || c == 8205);\n    // zero width sp, zw non join, zw join, soft hyphen, zw join\n}\n```\n\nBy adding `c == 8205` to the condition, we ensure that the zero-width joiner character is not mistakenly categorized as an invisible character and is preserved during normalization.\n\nPlease try using this corrected function and running the test cases again to verify if the issue is resolved.",
