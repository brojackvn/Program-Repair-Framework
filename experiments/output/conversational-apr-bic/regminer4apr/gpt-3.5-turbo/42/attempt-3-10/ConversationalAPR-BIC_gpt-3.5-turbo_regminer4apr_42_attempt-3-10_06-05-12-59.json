        "response": "### Root Cause Analysis:\n\n1. The bug-inducing commit message mentions normalizing invisibles in text().\n2. The failing test case `org.jsoup.nodes.ElementTest#doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` indicates an issue related to normalizing text.\n3. The failing test case error message indicates an unexpected result: expected `<12>` but was `<10>`.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n1. The bug-inducing commit might have introduced changes to the text normalization process that caused incorrect handling of certain characters.\n2. The normalization process might have inadvertently removed or modified characters that should have been preserved.\n\n### Relationship to Regression-Fixing Patches:\n1. The buggy function `isInvisibleChar` checks for invisible characters based on their Unicode type and specific character codes.\n2. The bug could have been introduced by changes in the normalization process that incorrectly affected the handling of invisible characters.\n3. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the normalization process does not unintentionally alter or remove the specific invisible characters checked by the `isInvisibleChar` function.\n\n### Corrected Function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return (Character.getType(c) == 16 && (c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173)) ||\n           (Character.getType(c) == 6 && (c == 8204)); // Include additional check for ZWJ\n}\n``` \n\n### Explanation:\n1. In the corrected function, we have included an additional check for the Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ) character (Unicode code point 8204) under the `Character.getType(c) == 6` condition.\n2. By including the ZWJ character check, we ensure that the `isInvisibleChar` function correctly identifies ZWJ as an invisible character, addressing the bug introduced during the normalization process.\n3. This correction aligns with the intent of the `isInvisibleChar` function and ensures that the ZWJ character is properly handled.",
