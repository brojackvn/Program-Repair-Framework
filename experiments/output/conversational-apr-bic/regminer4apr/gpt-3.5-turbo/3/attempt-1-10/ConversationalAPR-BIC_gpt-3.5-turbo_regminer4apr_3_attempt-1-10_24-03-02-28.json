        "response": "### Root Cause Analysis:\n\n1. **Bug-Inducing Changes:**\n   - The bug-inducing changes added a condition to return `left.negate()` if `left.negate().equals(right)`.\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The added condition `if (left.negate().equals(right)) return left.negate();` is problematic as it can lead to incorrect results when dealing with implications.\n   - This change is causing the regression failures in the test cases as mentioned in the error messages.\n\n3. **Impact on the Functionality:**\n   - The additional condition is not handling implications correctly and is likely causing issues with equivalence and negation checks.\n\n### Corrected Function:\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE)\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.type() == TRUE)\n        return right;\n    if (right.type() == FALSE)\n        return this.not(left);\n    if (left.equals(right))\n        return this.verum();\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\n### Summary:\nThe introduced condition `if (left.negate().equals(right)) return left.negate();` in the `implication` function is incorrect and leads to regression failures by returning incorrect results for implications. Removing this condition and sticking to the original logic will resolve the regression issues and ensure the correct behavior of the function.",
