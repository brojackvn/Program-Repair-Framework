This indicates that changes made in the bug-inducing commit related to issue #283 are responsible for introducing the bug in the `reset` function.\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to review the changes made in the bug-inducing commit related to issue #283 and understand how they might have impacted the `reset` function. It is likely that some of the changes made in the bug-inducing commit unintentionally affected the state of variables used in the `reset` function.\n\nHere is the corrected `reset` function:\n\n```java\nfinal void reset() {\n\tthis.columnsToExtractInitialized = false;\n\tthis.currentRecord = 0;\n\tthis.column = 0;\n\tthis.headers = new String[0]; // Initialize headers to an empty array\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I have added the initialization of the `headers` variable to an empty array to ensure that it is properly reset during the `reset` operation. This change should address the bug introduced by the modifications related to issue #283 in the bug-inducing commit.",
