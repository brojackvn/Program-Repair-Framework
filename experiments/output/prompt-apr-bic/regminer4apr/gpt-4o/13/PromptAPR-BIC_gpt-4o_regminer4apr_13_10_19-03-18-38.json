        "response": "To identify and fix the regression bug in the given method, we need to carefully analyze the changes introduced by the bug-inducing commit and the behavior that led to the failing test case.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Functionality**:\n   - The original function searched for a key in `this.significant` lines and returned a `YamlNode` if the key matched certain conditions.\n   - The search was straightforward and only considered the unquoted key.\n\n2. **Changes Introduced**:\n   - The changes introduced a mechanism to try matching the key in different forms: unquoted, double-quoted, and single-quoted.\n   - The function iterates over these variations (`keys`) and attempts to find a match in the `this.significant` lines.\n\n3. **Error in the Changes**:\n   - The change to consider different quoted forms of the key was correct for handling escaped keys.\n   - However, the functionality to deal with multi-line YAML nodes using `this.significant.toYamlNode(line, this.guessIndentation)` was modified incorrectly.\n   - The original code directly used `toYamlNode(line)` without additional context like `this.guessIndentation`.\n\n4. **Failing Test Case**:\n   - The test case failure suggests that the expected behavior of fetching the correct `YamlNode` for a string key was not achieved.\n   - The error message indicates that the expected value was not retrieved, likely due to incorrect handling of multi-line values or the indentation context.\n\n### Fixing the Function\n\nTo fix the function, we should:\n\n1. Ensure that the multi-line YAML node parsing respects the necessary indentation context.\n2. Maintain the logic to handle keys in different forms while ensuring we correctly parse the YAML structure.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                // Ensure the correct context for indentation is used\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Fix\n\n- **Indentation Context**: The method `toYamlNode(line, this.guessIndentation)` is used to ensure that when dealing with multi-line YAML structures, the parsing respects the indentation level. This was the missing component leading to the test failure.\n- **Iterating Over Key Variants**: The logic to iterate over different key representations (unquoted, double-quoted, single-quoted) is kept, as it addresses the need for handling escaped keys.\n- **Return Behavior**: The method returns `null` if no match is found, consistent with the original intent and expected behavior. \n\nThis fix should resolve the issue and allow the test case to pass by correctly handling the parsing and retrieval of YAML nodes.",

        "response": "The bug in the provided code is introduced by modifying the handling of YAML keys. The original code was altered to check for keys that are either quoted or unquoted. The bug appears to be in the logic that attempts to match keys in the YAML lines. The modification added the ability to handle keys that are enclosed in quotes (both single and double). However, the logic seems to not handle some cases correctly, especially when dealing with multiline or indented structures.\n\nLet's analyze the changes step-by-step:\n\n1. **Addition of Quoted Keys**: The code now handles keys in three formats: unquoted (`key`), double-quoted (`\"key\"`), and single-quoted (`'key'`).\n\n2. **Iterating Over Keys**: The outer loop iterates over these three key formats. The inner loop checks each line of YAML against each key format.\n\n3. **Key Matching Logic**: There are several checks to identify whether a line contains a key:\n   - Checks if the line ends with `key:` (or its quoted versions).\n   - Uses regex to check if the line ends with `key: >` or `key: |`, indicating folded or literal block scalars.\n   - Checks if a line starts with `key:` or `- key:` for lists.\n\n4. **Return Value**: The function returns the `YamlNode` as soon as it finds a match.\n\nThe **bug** could be because the matching logic may not correctly handle certain structures, such as indented block structures. The change also introduced a more strict check for multiline values, which might not be comprehensive enough.\n\nTo fix the bug, we can consider the following:\n\n- Ensure correct handling of different key formats without missing valid YAML structures.\n- Properly handle cases where indentation or multiline structures might affect key matching.\n- Revisit the logic for detecting block scalars and ensure they are correctly identified and parsed.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n        final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n        for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > tryKey.length() + 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\n**Corrections Made**:\n- Moved the loop iterating over `keys` inside the loop iterating over `lines` to ensure each line is matched against all key formats.\n- Adjusted the length check condition to ensure it accurately checks beyond just the key and the colon.\n- Ensured logic consistency for handling different YAML structures.",

The check for a plain scalar was done with `trimmed.startsWith(key + \":\")`.\n\n2. **Changes Introduced**: The bug-inducing changes added a loop over `keys`, which is an array containing the key itself and its quoted versions. The logic inside the loop iterates over the same lines but now checks against each `tryKey`.\n\n3. **Error Identification**: The error message indicates that the function fails to return the correct value for a key when it is quoted. The pattern matching was modified to check for quoted keys, but something is still amiss.\n\n4. **Issue Analysis**: The critical issue seems to be with the handling of quoted keys. The function iterates over both unquoted and quoted versions of the key but does not handle the indentation guessing properly in all cases (particularly when calling `this.significant.toYamlNode`). The indentation guessing parameter was omitted in the bug-inducing changes.\n\n5. **Solution**: Reintroduce the `guessIndentation` parameter in the `toYamlNode` call within the loop to restore the original behavior that was inadvertently altered by the bug-inducing changes.\n\nLet's correct the function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation // Reintroduce the guessIndentation parameter\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\nThis fix ensures that the function correctly processes both quoted and unquoted keys with proper indentation handling, addressing the regression bug introduced by the changes.",

        "response": "To understand the problem, let's go through the changes step-by-step and identify the root cause of the regression:\n\n### Bug-Inducing Changes Analysis:\n\n1. **Modified Logic for Key Matching:**\n   - The original function iterated through `this.significant` lines and checked if each line ends or starts with `key + \":\"` using simple string matching.\n   - The new logic introduces an array of `keys` which includes the original key, the key wrapped in double quotes, and the key wrapped in single quotes. It then iterates over these keys.\n\n2. **Pattern Matching:**\n   - The original logic checked if the line ends with `key + \":\"` using `trimmed.endsWith(key + \":\")` and two pattern matches with `>` and `|`.\n   - The updated logic replaced direct checks with pattern matches on `tryKey`, which is derived from the keys array.\n\n3. **Return Value Logic:**\n   - Originally, it returned `value` after iterating through all lines.\n   - In the modified version, if `value` is set (i.e., not null), it immediately returns `value`.\n\n4. **Return Statement at the End:**\n   - The original code returned `value`, which would be null if no match was found.\n   - The updated version explicitly returns null if no value was found, which is not a change in functionality but clarity.\n\n### Root Cause of Regression:\n\nThe failure in the test case `com.amihaiemil.eoyaml.ReadYamlMappingTest#returnsValueOfStringKeys` is likely due to the way keys are matched or the immediate return of `value`. If a key is found and `value` is set, it should return immediately. However, the issue may lie in how keys are checked. Originally, the code specifically checked for `key + \":\"` directly, and the pattern matching changes might not be capturing all valid cases correctly.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo fix the regression, we should ensure that the matching logic is robust and correctly identifies keys both with and without quotes. The guessIndentation should be used when calling `toYamlNode` as it was in the original logic. We also need to ensure that scalar values are correctly recognized.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > tryKey.length() + 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Fixes:\n\n- **Pattern Matching:** Ensure pattern matching is correctly using `Pattern.quote` to handle special characters in keys.\n- **Guess Indentation:** Use `this.guessIndentation` when calling `toYamlNode`.\n- **Scalar Matching:** Correct the logic to correctly check the length after `tryKey + \":\"` for scalar matching.\n\nThis version should restore the functionality while maintaining the ability to recognize quoted keys.",

The root cause likely relates to:\n\n- **Incorrect Pattern Matching or Key Format:**\n  The key formats introduced may not correctly match the YAML content if the keys in the YAML are not consistently quoted or escaped.\n  \n- **Order of Formats:**\n  The order of trying different key formats might affect the outcome if the YAML content uses a specific format that is checked later in the loop.\n\n- **Returning `null`:**\n  The function returns `null` instead of `value` if no match is found, which deviates from the original behavior where `value` would be returned even if it was `null`.\n\n### Corrected Function\n\nTo fix the issue, we should ensure the function adheres to the following:\n\n- Maintain the check for all three key formats.\n- Ensure proper pattern matching.\n- Return `value` instead of `null` if no match is found.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for (final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if (trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if ((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if (value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return value; // Changed back to return 'value' instead of 'null'\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected function should handle different key formats correctly and return the expected `YamlNode` or `null` if no matches are found, consistent with the expected behavior before the bug-inducing changes.",

The original code was directly working with the key, while the modification added a loop to try different variations of the key (plain, double-quoted, and single-quoted). This change was intended to handle escaped keys correctly.\n\nHowever, the bug seems to be introduced in the logic that determines the value associated with these keys. The main issue is that the condition to create a `ReadPlainScalar` object has been altered and no longer correctly identifies the scalar value.\n\nLet's revisit the original logic and compare it to the current logic:\n\n1. **Original logic**:\n   - It checked if the `trimmed` line starts with `key:` and the length is greater than 1.\n   - It created a `ReadPlainScalar` object if the above condition was satisfied.\n\n2. **Modified logic**:\n   - The logic was expanded to check for key variations, but the condition handling did not accommodate the prefixed `- ` which is common in YAML lists.\n   - The condition `(trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\") || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))` ensures it checks for both prefixed and non-prefixed keys.\n\nThe correct fix would be to ensure the logic encompasses the prefixed keys as well, while still maintaining the original functionality of handling plain scalar values correctly.\n\nHere's the revised function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > tryKey.length() + 1 // Ensure it has content after \":\"\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\nKey changes:\n- The condition inside the `else if` checks for both prefixed and non-prefixed keys.\n- Ensures that there is content after the key by checking `trimmed.length() > tryKey.length() + 1`. \n\nThis should address the regression introduced while handling escaped keys and ensure that scalar values are correctly identified and returned.",

        "response": "The function `valueOfStringKey` is designed to search for a key within a YAML structure and return its associated `YamlNode`. The bug was introduced when additional logic was added to handle keys that might be enclosed in quotes (either single or double). However, the logic likely fails under certain conditions, as evidenced by the failing test case and error message.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the problem and the solution:\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1. **Original Functionality**:\n   - The function iterates over each `YamlLine` in `this.significant`.\n   - It checks if the line ends with the key followed by a colon or matches a pattern with a colon followed by either `>` or `|`.\n   - If a match is found, it converts the line to a `YamlNode` and returns it.\n   - If the line starts with the key followed by a colon and is longer than one character, it creates a `ReadPlainScalar` from the line and returns it.\n\n2. **Changes Introduced**:\n   - The function was modified to handle keys that may be quoted.\n   - It creates an array `keys` with the original key, the key wrapped in double quotes, and the key wrapped in single quotes.\n   - It then iterates over each `tryKey` in `keys` and performs the same checks as the original function.\n\n3. **Potential Issue**:\n   - The modification introduces a loop over the `keys` array, but doesn't correctly handle cases where the `tryKey` is quoted.\n   - If the YAML lines don't match the quoted keys, the function may not return the expected value.\n   - The original handling of indentation (`this.guessIndentation`) was removed in the bug-inducing changes when calling `toYamlNode`.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo fix the regression, we need to ensure the function accurately handles quoted keys and properly processes the YAML lines:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(line, this.guessIndentation);\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > tryKey.length() + 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **Indentation Handling**: Ensure that `this.guessIndentation` is passed to `toYamlNode`.\n- **Length Check**: Ensure the length check uses `tryKey.length() + 1` to account for keys with different lengths due to quoting.\n- **Pattern Quoting**: Use `Pattern.quote` consistently to correctly handle any special characters in the key.\n\nThese changes should restore the correct functionality and resolve the failing test case by accurately processing YAML keys, whether quoted or not.",

        "response": "To identify the root cause of the bug, let's break down the changes introduced in the bug-inducing commit and analyze the failing test case.\n\n### Analysis of Changes:\n\n1. **Introduction of `keys` Array**:\n   - The original code did not have an array of different key formats. It only considered the key as it is.\n   - The change introduced handling for three formats of the key: unquoted, double-quoted, and single-quoted.\n\n2. **Loop through `keys`**:\n   - A new outer loop was introduced to iterate over these different key formats.\n\n3. **Logic for Identifying a Key**:\n   - The original logic checked if a line ends with `key + \":\"`, or matches specific patterns for multi-line YAML values.\n   - It then checked if a line starts with `key + \":\"` or `\"- \" + key + \":\"` to identify scalar values.\n   - If a match is found, it processes the line to either parse it as a YAML node or a plain scalar.\n\n4. **Return Value**:\n   - The original function returned the `value` after all lines were checked.\n   - The bug-inducing change returns `null` if none of the formats of the key lead to finding a value.\n\n### Analysis of the Failing Test Case:\n\n- The test expects a YAML value to be parsed correctly when using string keys.\n- The error suggests the expected value `\"2\"` is not being returned, indicating that the logic fails to identify the key correctly or does not parse it as expected.\n\n### Root Cause:\n\nThe primary issue seems to be the handling of different key formats. While the idea is to support keys that may be quoted or unquoted, the logic to identify and parse these correctly seems to fail:\n\n1. **Key Format Handling**:\n   - The introduction of multiple key formats is correct, but the logic inside the loop does not robustly check for all conditions where a key might be used (e.g., within sequences, as part of multi-line values).\n\n2. **Return Logic**:\n   - The function now returns `null` if no match is found, which might not be ideal if one format could be correct but is not checked properly due to control flow errors.\n\n### Proposed Fix:\n\nTo correct this function, let's ensure that the logic correctly handles quoted and unquoted keys and maintains the original intention of returning the first found value:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > tryKey.length() + 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return value;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Fix:\n\n- **Check Length After Key**: Ensure that the line is long enough after the key to prevent false positives.\n- **Return Value**: If a value is found during any iteration, return it immediately, otherwise return `value` which remains `null` if no key matches.\n- **Pattern Matching**: Use `Pattern.quote` for regex patterns to ensure that special characters in keys are not misinterpreted by the regex engine.\n\nThis fix will ensure that the function correctly processes both quoted and unquoted keys and returns the appropriate value when found.",

        "response": "To address the regression bug introduced by the changes, let's analyze the differences and identify what went wrong:\n\n### Analysis of Changes:\n1. **Original Code:**\n   - The original code iterated over `this.significant` lines, trimming each line and checking if the line ended with `key + \":\"` or matched certain patterns.\n   - It returned a `YamlNode` if a match was found using `this.significant.toYamlNode(line)`.\n   - In the case of a plain scalar, it created a `ReadPlainScalar`.\n\n2. **Changes Introduced:**\n   - The changes introduced an array `keys` containing the original key and its quoted versions (`\"` and `'`).\n   - The function iterates over each version of the key, checking for matches in the same manner as the original code.\n   - The function returns `null` if no value is found, instead of returning `value`.\n\n### Problem:\nThe significant change in behavior is the introduction of the `keys` array and iterating over it. While this is not inherently problematic, the key issue arises from:\n- The `toYamlNode` method in the modified code calls `this.significant.toYamlNode(line, this.guessIndentation)`, but in the bug-inducing change, it was not calling it with `this.guessIndentation`. This might cause discrepancies in how the node is parsed.\n- Another issue is the removal of returning `value` as the final return statement, which could lead to incorrect `null` returns in some cases.\n\n### Fix:\nWe need to ensure that the `toYamlNode` method is called correctly with the necessary indentation argument. Also, we should return `value` instead of `null` at the end of the function, which preserves the behavior of returning a parsed value if it is found.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\nprivate YamlNode valueOfStringKey(final String key) {\n    YamlNode value = null;\n    final String[] keys = new String[] {\n        key,\n        \"\\\"\" + key + \"\\\"\",\n        \"'\" + key + \"'\",\n    };\n    for(final String tryKey : keys) {\n        for (final YamlLine line : this.significant) {\n            final String trimmed = line.trimmed();\n            if(trimmed.endsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\>$\")\n                || trimmed.matches(\"^\" + Pattern.quote(tryKey) + \"\\\\:[ ]*\\\\|$\")\n            ) {\n                value = this.significant.toYamlNode(\n                    line, this.guessIndentation\n                );\n            } else if((trimmed.startsWith(tryKey + \":\")\n                || trimmed.startsWith(\"- \" + tryKey + \":\"))\n                && trimmed.length() > 1\n            ) {\n                value = new ReadPlainScalar(this.all, line);\n            }\n            if(value != null) {\n                return value;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return value;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`toYamlNode` Method**: Ensure it is called with `this.guessIndentation` for correct node parsing.\n- **Return Statement**: The function will now return `value` if found, consistent with the behavior before the bug-inducing changes.\n\nThis fix should correct the regression bug and pass the previously failing test cases.",
