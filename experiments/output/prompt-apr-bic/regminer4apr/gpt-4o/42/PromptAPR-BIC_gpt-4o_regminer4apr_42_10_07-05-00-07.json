The commit message \"Normalize invisibles in text()\" suggests that there were changes in the handling of invisible characters during text normalization. The failing test case indicates that the zero-width joiner (ZWJ) character is being incorrectly handled or removed during this process.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown to identify the root cause and fix the function:\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The function `isInvisibleChar` is supposed to identify certain invisible characters. The failing test case indicates that the zero-width joiner (ZWJ) character is being incorrectly handled when text is normalized.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Function**: The current implementation checks if the character's type is 16 (which corresponds to `Character.FORMAT` in Java) and if it matches one of the specific invisible characters (zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner, zero-width joiner, and soft hyphen).\n\n3. **Issue with the Condition**: The condition `Character.getType(c) == 16` is too restrictive. It seems the intention was to identify these invisible characters specifically rather than relying on the character type alone.\n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**: The primary problem is that the logic is dependent on the character type, which might not be necessary or correct for all the characters in question. The zero-width joiner (ZWJ) might not have a type of 16, which leads to incorrect behavior.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width space, zero width non joiner, zero width joiner, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Remove Character Type Check**: By removing `Character.getType(c) == 16`, we ensure that the check is solely based on specific Unicode values for the invisible characters in question. This eliminates any issues related to incorrect assumptions about character type.\n- **Explicit Matching**: We explicitly check against the Unicode code points for zero-width space (8203), zero-width non-joiner (8204), zero-width joiner (8205), and soft hyphen (173). This ensures accurate detection of these specific invisible characters.\n\nBy making this change, the function will correctly identify the invisible characters regardless of any other changes in how text normalization handles character types, thus resolving the regression issue.",

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understand the Function Purpose:**\n   - The function `isInvisibleChar` is intended to identify certain invisible characters. The characters in question are zero-width space (ZWSP), zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ), zero-width joiner (ZWJ), and soft hyphen. Their Unicode values are 8203, 8204, 8205, and 173, respectively.\n\n2. **Bug-Inducing Commit Insight:**\n   - The commit message \"Normalize invisibles in text()\" suggests that changes were made to how invisible characters are handled during text normalization. This could mean that invisible characters are altered, removed, or treated differently in some processing step.\n\n3. **Failing Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The test case `doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` expects the number of characters after normalization to remain the same (expected: 12), but due to the bug, it was reduced (actual: 10).\n   - This implies that some characters, likely invisible ones that were supposed to be preserved, are being incorrectly removed or not accounted for.\n\n4. **Character.getType Insight:**\n   - The condition `Character.getType(c) == 16` checks if the character type is \"FORMAT\". However, this condition alone is not sufficient to identify the specific invisible characters in question because not all format characters are those specific invisibles.\n\n5. **Root Cause Hypothesis:**\n   - The root cause is likely that the `isInvisibleChar` function incorrectly identifies characters based on their type alone, leading to unintended behavior when certain invisible characters are supposed to be preserved.\n\n6. **Solution:**\n   - We should adjust the function so that it correctly identifies only the intended invisible characters without relying solely on their type.\n\n### Corrected Function\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    // Directly check if the character is one of the specific invisible characters\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Solution\n\n- By directly checking the Unicode values, we ensure that only the intended invisible characters are identified. This avoids any issues arising from other characters that might have the same type but are not supposed to be considered invisible in this context.\n- This approach aligns with the test case expectations that certain invisible characters should not be removed during normalization, thus resolving the regression issue.",

The specific characters mentioned are:\n\n- Zero Width Space (U+200B)\n- Zero Width Non-Joiner (U+200C)\n- Zero Width Joiner (U+200D)\n- Soft Hyphen (U+00AD)\n\nThe logic in the function uses `Character.getType(c) == 16` to filter characters. This condition checks if the character type is `FORMAT` (16 is the constant value for `Character.FORMAT`).\n\n### Analysis of the Bug-Inducing Commit Message\n\nThe commit message \"Normalize invisibles in text()\" suggests that the change was related to handling invisible characters, which might have affected the behavior of `isInvisibleChar`.\n\n### Failing Test Case\n\nThe failing test case `doesntDeleteZWJWhenNormalizingText` indicates that the function is incorrectly classifying or handling the Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ) character, causing an assertion error. \n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe condition `Character.getType(c) == 16` is overly restrictive for determining invisibility. Specifically, it assumes that only characters of type `FORMAT` can be invisible, and it does not account for the fact that some characters, such as the Soft Hyphen (U+00AD), might not be of this type.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo address this issue, we should remove the restriction `Character.getType(c) == 16` and directly check for the specific invisible characters of interest. This will ensure that all specified characters are correctly identified as invisible, regardless of their type classification.\n\nHere is the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isInvisibleChar(int c) {\n    return c == 8203 || c == 8204 || c == 8205 || c == 173;\n    // zero width sp, zw non join, zw join, soft hyphen\n}\n```\n\nThis adjustment ensures that the function correctly identifies all specified invisible characters, resolving the regression issue highlighted by the test case.",
