This is likely intended to provide a default name to handle cases where `testName` is empty, but it changes the behavior of the function.\n\n3. **Failing Test Case:** The test case `hudson.tasks.junit.CaseResultTest#emptyName` fails because it likely expects a specific return value or behavior when `testName` is empty. The error message indicates that the test expected a different result than \"SUCCESS\".\n\n### Reasoning:\n- Returning \"(?)\" when `testName` is empty changes the output of the function and can cause unexpected behavior in parts of the system that rely on the return value of `getName()`.\n- The test case failure suggests that the system expects `testName` to return either an empty string or a different default value, but not \"(?)\".\n\n### Solution:\nTo fix the regression, we need to revert the behavior to its original logic, ensuring that the `getName()` method returns `testName` without modification, even if it is empty.\n\n```java\n@Exported(visibility=999)\npublic @Override String getName() {\n    return testName; // Revert to always returning testName, even if empty\n}\n```\n\n### Summary:\nThe regression was caused by introducing a default return value of \"(?)\" for empty `testName`, which was inconsistent with the expected behavior in the failing test case. Reverting to always returning `testName`, regardless of its content, should align the method with the expected behavior and fix the test case.",

The intended behavior is to return \"(?)\" when `testName` is empty. However, it seems like this change is causing a test failure.\n\n### Analyzing the Failing Test Case\n\nThe failing test case is `hudson.tasks.junit.CaseResultTest#emptyName` which expects a certain behavior when `testName` is empty. The error message indicates that the expected outcome was not met, likely because returning \"(?)\" was not the intended behavior for an empty `testName`.\n\n### Possible Root Cause\n\nThe addition of returning \"(?)\" might not align with the expected behavior of the system or the specific test case. Instead of returning a placeholder like \"(?)\", perhaps the expected behavior is to return some other default value or handle the empty case differently.\n\n### Fixing the Bug\n\nTo fix this regression, we should revert the behavior to what it was before the bug-inducing change. Given that the test case expects `testName` to be handled in a specific way when it's empty, we should remove or adjust the conditional check added.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\n@Exported(visibility=999)\npublic @Override String getName() {\n    return testName; // Return the testName directly, even if it's empty.\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- By reverting to the original behavior where `testName` is returned directly, we align with the expected behavior of the system or the test case.\n- If `testName` is empty, it returns an empty string, which seems to be the expected outcome for the failing test case.\n\nThis solution assumes that the system or the test harness has some other mechanism to handle empty test names appropriately, or the expectation is indeed to return an empty string rather than a placeholder like \"(?)\".",
