The error messages and the changes made in the bug-inducing commit suggest that some logical simplifications or conditions were either added incorrectly or misplaced. \n\nLet's break down the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Simplifications**:\n   - If `left` is `FALSE` or `right` is `TRUE`, the implication should always be `TRUE` (`verum()`).\n   - If `left` is `TRUE`, then the implication depends solely on `right`.\n   - If `right` is `FALSE`, then the implication is equivalent to `not(left)`.\n\n2. **Equality and Negation Simplifications**:\n   - If `left` equals `right`, the implication is `TRUE` (`verum()`).\n   - If `left.negate().equals(right)`, it implies `left` is the opposite of `right`, so traditionally this would simplify to `right`, but we need to check if this condition is correctly positioned or necessary.\n\n3. **Caching of Implications**:\n   - If none of the above conditions apply, check if the implication already exists in the cache. If not, create a new `Implication` object, cache it, and return it.\n\nThe problematic line is likely the one involving `left.negate().equals(right)`. This condition should simplify to `right` directly, rather than returning `left.negate()`.\n\nHere's the corrected function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE)\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.type() == TRUE)\n        return right;\n    if (right.type() == FALSE)\n        return this.not(left);\n    if (left.equals(right))\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.negate().equals(right))\n        return right; // Corrected to return 'right'\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\nIn this fix, we corrected the logic for when `left.negate().equals(right)` to return `right` instead of `left.negate()`. This change ensures the implication logic adheres to standard logical simplification rules.",

If `left` is the negation of `right`, the implication should simplify to `right`, which is `FALSE`, not `left.negate()`.\n\n3. **Impact on Test Cases:**\n   - The test cases likely check for the correct simplification of implications.\n   - The incorrect simplification introduced by the bug-inducing change would lead to unexpected results, causing the test failures.\n\n4. **Fixing the Bug:**\n   - We need to correct the logic for when `left` is the negation of `right`. Instead of returning `left.negate()`, we should return `right`, which is `FALSE`.\n\n### Corrected Function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE)\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.type() == TRUE)\n        return right;\n    if (right.type() == FALSE)\n        return this.not(left);\n    if (left.equals(right))\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.negate().equals(right))\n        return right;  // Correct the logic here to return right, which is FALSE\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\nThis correction should address the test failures by ensuring the logical implications are simplified correctly.",

The method seems to handle the logical implication operation between two formulas, `left` and `right`.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication Logic**:\n   - Implication (A → B) is logically equivalent to ¬A ∨ B.\n   - Special cases:\n     - If `left` (A) is `FALSE`, the implication is always `TRUE` (verum), since FALSE implies anything.\n     - If `right` (B) is `TRUE`, the implication is always `TRUE`, since anything implies TRUE.\n     - If `left` (A) is `TRUE`, the implication evaluates to `right` (B).\n     - If `right` (B) is `FALSE`, the implication is ¬A (not left).\n\n2. **Bug-Inducing Changes**:\n   - The added line `if (left.negate().equals(right)) return left.negate();` is incorrect within the context of logical implication.\n   - This line seems to handle the case where `left` is the negation of `right`, but it incorrectly returns `left.negate()`, which is `¬A`. This does not align with the logical implication rules.\n\n3. **Correct Implementation**:\n   - The correct behavior when `left` is the negation of `right` is to return `right` (B) or `verum` (TRUE) since ¬A → A is always TRUE.\n   - Removing the problematic condition should resolve the errors highlighted in the failing test cases.\n\n### Corrected Function\n\nHere is the revised function:\n\n```java\npublic Formula implication(final Formula left, final Formula right) {\n    if (left.type() == FALSE || right.type() == TRUE)\n        return this.verum();\n    if (left.type() == TRUE)\n        return right;\n    if (right.type() == FALSE)\n        return this.not(left);\n    if (left.equals(right))\n        return this.verum();\n    // The problematic line is removed.\n    final Pair<Formula, Formula> key = new Pair<>(left, right);\n    Implication implication = this.implications.get(key);\n    if (implication == null) {\n        implication = new Implication(left, right, this);\n        this.implications.put(key, implication);\n    }\n    return implication;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The removal of the condition `if (left.negate().equals(right)) return left.negate();` aligns the function with the logical rules of implication.\n- The method now correctly handles all special cases of implication without introducing incorrect logic that was causing the regression failures.\n- The rest of the logic for creating and caching implications is preserved as it was not implicated in the reported issues.",
