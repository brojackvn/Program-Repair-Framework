        "response": "The error message indicates that the function is throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` even when the `times` counter is a positive number. This suggests that the condition for throwing the exception is incorrect. The exception should be thrown only if `this.times` is less than or equal to zero before entering the loop, as it doesn't make sense to try to apply a function zero or negative times.\n\nAdditionally, the logic suggests that the function should ensure that it doesn't throw an exception based on the result of the repeated application of the function unless `this.times` is indeed zero or negative. Let's correct the logic:\n\n1. Check if `this.times` is less than or equal to zero before the loop and throw an exception if it is.\n2. Apply the function the specified number of times.\n3. Return the result.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic Y apply(final X input) throws Exception {\n    if (this.times <= 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n            new FormattedText(\n                \"Repeat counter is equal or less than zero: %d\",\n                this.times\n            ).asString()\n        );\n    }\n    Y result = null;\n    for (int idx = 0; idx < this.times; ++idx) {\n        result = this.func.apply(input);\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis function now checks if `this.times` is less than or equal to zero before trying to apply the function, preventing any attempt to apply the function zero or negative times and ensuring that the exception is thrown appropriately.",
